The waters came down from underneath, from the right side of the temple, on the south of the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward, and led me around by the way outside to the outer gate, by the way of the gate that looks toward the east. Behold, waters ran out on the right side. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>When the man went out eastward with the line in his hand, he measured one thousand cubits,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimeters.</span></a> and he caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the ankles.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Again he measured one thousand, and caused me to pass through the waters, waters that were to the knees. Again he measured one thousand, and caused me to pass through waters that were to the waist.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Afterward he measured one thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass through, for the waters had risen, waters to swim in, a river that could not be walked through. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>He said to me, “Son of man, have you seen this?” </div><div class='p'>Then he brought me and caused me to return to the bank of the river.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Now when I had returned, behold, on the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Then he said to me, “These waters flow out toward the eastern region and will go down into the Arabah.

From En Gedi even to En Eglaim will be a place for the spreading of nets.
