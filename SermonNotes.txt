Genesis 6:
The World Flooded by Sin
Judgement and Grace through the Flood
Introduction: When the Way of Cain Becomes the World
Genesis 3 revealed the fracture. Trust between God and humanity collapsed, and the human heart turned inward. Genesis 4 revealed the spread. Sin moved outward from the heart into relationships, from resentment into violence, from private rebellion into a settled pattern of life. Cain did not repent. He moved on. He built. He named. He established a line in which rebellion was no longer exceptional, but normal.
Genesis 5 followed with a genealogy that did not resolve the problem. Life continued. Generations multiplied. Names were recorded. Years were counted. Culture advanced. But nothing was healed. The chapter moves forward relentlessly, and yet it circles the same truth again and again. And he died. The phrase is repeated with almost liturgical regularity, not as commentary, but as verdict. Death is no longer a threat hanging over humanity; it is now the governing reality of human history. Each life ends the same way. Progress does not overcome it. Time does not soften it. Death stands as the unbroken witness that Eden has truly been lost. History moves forward, but it does so under the shadow of God’s word fulfilled.
Genesis 6 doesn’t introduce a new crisis. It reveals the destination of the path already taken. What began as mistrust becomes corruption. What began as autonomy becomes violence. What began with one man now defines the whole world. The flood is not divine overreaction. It is moral verdict.
Humanity Multiplies, Corruption Deepens
Genesis 6:1–2
Exegesis
 Humanity continues to multiply, just as God commanded in the beginning. The mandate of Genesis 1 to fill the earth has not been revoked. Families form, societies expand, and human life spreads across the world. Genesis does not portray a stagnant civilisation, but a growing one.
Yet Scripture is careful to distinguish fruitfulness from faithfulness. The text does not describe chaos replacing order. It describes order being redirected. The structures God created for life remain in place, but they are now governed by desire rather than by God’s word. Boundaries erode. What was ordered toward life before God is reshaped by human autonomy. Sin does not halt human development. It redirects it.
Metaphor
 The image is of a river that still flows, but whose banks have collapsed. The water remains, but instead of nourishing the land, it overwhelms and destroys it.
Quote
 Herman Bavinck observed with clarity that sin does not abolish nature, but corrupts it.
Application
 Cultural growth must never be confused with moral health. A society can flourish outwardly while decaying inwardly. When desire replaces obedience, progress becomes a vehicle for corruption rather than blessing.

The Withdrawal of Restraining Grace
Genesis 6:3
~~ Exegesis ~~
 When the Lord declares, “My Spirit shall not abide in man forever,” He is not expressing impatience or fatigue. He is announcing that restraint will not continue indefinitely. Up to this point, human life has been sustained by grace far beyond what it deserves. History has continued because God has held back the full consequences of sin.
This pattern is not unique to Genesis. Paul later describes the same kind of judgement in Romans 1, not as sudden destruction, but as God “giving them over” to what they have already chosen. Humanity suppresses the truth, exchanges God for autonomy, and the judgement that follows is God stepping back. Desire is no longer restrained. Corruption is allowed to mature.
Genesis 6:3 functions in the same way. God does not inject new evil into the world. He removes the sustaining presence that has been restraining it. Judgement arrives, not as intrusion, but as release. Humanity is permitted to experience the trajectory it has insisted upon.
~~ Metaphor ~~
 The image is of a hand that has been holding a failing structure upright. When the hand is withdrawn, the collapse does not create the weakness; it reveals it.
~~ Quote ~~
 John Calvin observed that when God judges a people, He often does so by giving them over to themselves.
~~ Application ~~
 This confronts us with a sobering truth. Grace is not only what forgives; it is also what restrains. When God steps back, judgement has already begun. The most severe judgement is not sudden catastrophe, but unchecked self-rule, where God allows humanity to live fully inside the consequences of its own desires.

A World Diagnosed, Not Accused
Genesis 6:5
~~ Exegesis ~~
 The language of this verse is exhaustive. Every intention of the thoughts of the human heart is described as only evil continually. Scripture is not exaggerating for effect. It is diagnosing a condition.
This is not a catalogue of isolated sins, but a description of orientation. Humanity still thinks, plans, imagines, and creates. The image of God is not erased. But it is morally bent inward. Genesis 3 explained how the will became distorted. Genesis 6 shows what happens when that distortion governs history unchecked.
~~ Metaphor ~~
 The image is of a compass that still moves, but always points away from true north.
~~ Quote ~~
 R. C. Sproul explained that total depravity does not mean humanity is as bad as it could be, but that sin has extended to every faculty.
~~ Application ~
 Sin is not the absence of intention. It is intention aimed away from God. Our problem is not that we lack desire, but that our desires are disordered. Left to ourselves, we do not drift toward God. We drift away.
The Grief of a Holy God
Genesis 6:6–7
Exegesis
 When Scripture tells us that God grieved, it is not describing uncertainty, regret, or surprise. This language is covenantal, not psychological. It expresses the moral collision between God’s holiness and a world saturated with corruption.
God’s grief reveals that His opposition to sin is not detached or abstract. He does not look upon violence and self-rule with indifference. Judgement flows not from irritation, but from incompatibility. A holy God cannot make peace with what destroys His creation.
Metaphor
 The image is of a master craftsman standing before a structure that can no longer bear weight. The grief is real, not because the builder failed, but because what was entrusted to care has been twisted beyond endurance.
Quote
 Geerhardus Vos wrote that the repentance of God signifies not a change in His eternal purpose, but a change in His dealings.
Application
 If our theology allows judgement but excludes grief, we have reduced God to an abstraction. Scripture presents a God whose holiness responds personally to corruption, and whose judgement is never separated from moral seriousness.
Grace Interrupts Total Collapse
Genesis 6:8-9
Exegesis
 The narrative reaches what appears to be a terminal diagnosis. Humanity is described in exhaustive moral terms. Nothing in the flow of the text suggests recovery or reversal. If the story continued on its own momentum, judgement would be inevitable.
And then the text turns. “But Noah found favour in the eyes of the LORD.”That statement stands on its own. It is not immediately explained, qualified, or grounded in Noah’s behaviour. The narrative does not pause to justify God’s choice. It simply declares it.
Only later, in Genesis 6:9, are we told that Noah was righteous and walked with God. That description is true, but it is not presented as the cause of God’s favour. It is the result of it. The order matters. Scripture does not say that Noah was righteous and therefore found favour. It says he found favour, and then goes on to describe the kind of man he became and was.
This is consistent with how Scripture regularly speaks about grace. God’s favour is not a reward for righteousness achieved independently. It is the ground from which righteousness grows. If righteousness were the explanation for favour, then grace would no longer be grace. It would be recognition. But Genesis is careful not to frame it that way.
The narrative order protects us from turning Noah into a moral exception who rescued himself by superior virtue. Noah’s obedience is real. His faithfulness is genuine. But neither is presented as the reason God intervened. God’s favour is the initiating cause. Noah’s righteousness is the shaped outcome.
That is why the text reads the way it does. Favour comes first, because salvation always begins with God’s initiative, not human qualification. Genesis 6 is not teaching that one good man saved the world. It is teaching that God preserved His promise by graciously setting one man apart, and then forming his life in obedience to that grace.
So the line “favour comes first” is not rhetorical flourish. It is a guardrail. It ensures that even here, before covenant, before law, before sacrifice, the story of redemption is already operating on the logic of grace.
If grace were given because of righteousness already achieved, it would no longer be grace at all. It would be wages. And Scripture is clear that God does not save by paying humanity what it deserves.
Metaphor
 The image is not of a man climbing out of a pit, but of a hand reaching down into it. Noah does not distinguish himself in order to be saved. He is distinguished by grace to serve God’s saving purpose.
Quote
 Geerhardus Vos observed that grace does not assist fallen humanity, but interrupts it.
Application
Hope never rests on humanity recovering itself. It rests on God intervening when recovery is no longer possible. If grace depended on moral momentum, it would never arrive. It comes only when the illusion of self-rescue has been stripped away and God alone can act.
Salvation Through Judgement
Genesis 6:19
Exegesis
God commands Noah to bring representatives of living creatures into the ark in order to preserve life. The instruction is deliberate and comprehensive. Life is not preserved accidentally or selectively. It is preserved by divine intention. God names what will pass through the judgement and what will not.
The ark, therefore, is not an escape from judgement. It is salvation through judgement. There is one flood, one divine act, one event that encompasses the whole world. Scripture does not present multiple responses to sin, one gentle and one severe. There is a single response, and it is experienced differently depending on one’s relationship to God’s provision.
The difference lies not in the waters, but in whether one is inside the ark. The same flood that destroys the world lifts the vessel of refuge. The same judgement that brings death also carries life safely through. Salvation does not occur beside judgement, but within it.
This pattern will not disappear as Scripture unfolds. Again and again, God’s saving work moves through judgement rather than around it. Rescue is never found by avoiding God’s verdict, but by trusting the means He appoints. The ark does not cancel the flood. It bears its weight.
Metaphor
 The image is of a storm that destroys what is unanchored and carries the secured vessel safely to the other side.
Quote
 Edmund Clowney wrote that God saves His people not by removing judgement, but by carrying them safely through it.
Application
 Grace does not cancel judgement. It shelters from it. Salvation is never found by avoiding God’s verdict, but by trusting God’s provision.
Conclusion: Preservation, Not Reset
From the Ark to the Cross
Exegesis
 The flood restrains corruption, but it does not heal the human heart. When the waters recede, sin remains. Death remains. The same patterns reappear. What Genesis shows us here is that judgement, however severe, cannot recreate humanity. It can limit evil. It can preserve life. But it cannot restore what was lost in Eden.
This is why the flood is not a restart of creation. God is not beginning again with a blank slate. He is preserving the line of promise. Noah is not a new Adam in the sense of replacement, but a bearer of continuity. History is carried forward, not erased, because redemption is still to come.
Grace, therefore, is not postponed by judgement. It is protected by it. God restrains the world so that His promise does not collapse under the weight of human rebellion.
Metaphor
 The image is not of a fire extinguished completely, but of a wildfire brought under control. The flames are halted, not because the land is healed, but so that rebuilding can begin. Judgement contains destruction so that renewal remains possible.
Quote
 Augustine reminded the church that judgement restrains evil, but only grace renews the will. The flood restrains. It does not renew. Renewal must come another way.
Application
 The flood teaches us that judgement alone cannot save humanity, but without judgement humanity would destroy itself. God judges, and God preserves. He restrains evil, and He carries His promise forward through history.
And this is where the ark finally points beyond itself. It does not lead us back to Eden. It leads us forward to Christ. Once again, judgement and grace will meet. Not in water, but at a cross. There, judgement will not merely restrain sin, but deal with it. There, grace will not merely preserve life, but renew it.
The ark carried a remnant safely through the waters. Christ carries His people safely through judgement itself. And this time, the outcome is not preservation alone, but restoration. Not delay, but fulfilment. Not a guarded garden behind us, but a redeemed creation ahead.
The flood was not the end of the story.
 It was God ensuring that the gospel would have a future.
