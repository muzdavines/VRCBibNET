Genesis 6:
The World Flooded by Sin
Judgement and Grace through the Flood
Introduction: When the Way of Cain Becomes the World
Genesis 3 revealed the fracture. Trust between God and humanity collapsed, and the human heart turned inward. Genesis 4 revealed the spread. Sin moved outward from the heart into relationships, from resentment into violence, from private rebellion into a settled pattern of life. Cain did not repent. He moved on. He built. He named. He established a line in which rebellion was no longer exceptional, but normal.
Genesis 5 followed with a genealogy that did not resolve the problem. Life continued. Generations multiplied. Names were recorded. Years were counted. Culture advanced. But nothing was healed. The chapter moves forward relentlessly, and yet it circles the same truth again and again. And he died. The phrase is repeated with almost liturgical regularity, not as commentary, but as verdict. Death is no longer a threat hanging over humanity; it is now the governing reality of human history. Each life ends the same way. Progress does not overcome it. Time does not soften it. Death stands as the unbroken witness that Eden has truly been lost. History moves forward, but it does so under the shadow of God’s word fulfilled.
Genesis 6 doesn’t introduce a new crisis. It reveals the destination of the path already taken. What began as mistrust becomes corruption. What began as autonomy becomes violence. What began with one man now defines the whole world. The flood is not divine overreaction. It is moral verdict.
Humanity Multiplies, Corruption Deepens
Genesis 6:1–2
Exegesis
 Humanity continues to multiply, just as God commanded in the beginning. The mandate of Genesis 1 to fill the earth has not been revoked. Families form, societies expand, and human life spreads across the world. Genesis does not portray a stagnant civilisation, but a growing one.
Yet Scripture is careful to distinguish fruitfulness from faithfulness. The text does not describe chaos replacing order. It describes order being redirected. The structures God created for life remain in place, but they are now governed by desire rather than by God’s word. Boundaries erode. What was ordered toward life before God is reshaped by human autonomy. Sin does not halt human development. It redirects it.
Metaphor
 The image is of a river that still flows, but whose banks have collapsed. The water remains, but instead of nourishing the land, it overwhelms and destroys it.
Quote
 Herman Bavinck observed with clarity that sin does not abolish nature, but corrupts it.
Application
 Cultural growth must never be confused with moral health. A society can flourish outwardly while decaying inwardly. When desire replaces obedience, progress becomes a vehicle for corruption rather than blessing.

The Withdrawal of Restraining Grace
Genesis 6:3
~~ Exegesis ~~
When God says, “My Spirit shall not abide in man forever,” He isn’t losing patience or getting worn down. He’s saying that this mess can’t continue indefinitely. The world has been surviving on restraint. Life keeps going not because it’s healthy, but because God has been holding back the full weight of sin.
Paul describes the same thing in Romans 1. God’s judgement often comes, not as sudden destruction, but as release. God “gives them over” to what they keep choosing. Truth is suppressed, God is exchanged for autonomy, and the restraint is removed. Desire runs without brakes, and corruption is allowed to ripen.
Genesis 6:3 works the same way. God doesn’t introduce new evil. He steps back. Judgement arrives, not as intrusion, but as withdrawal. Humanity is permitted to live fully inside the direction it has insisted upon.
That’s what makes this frightening. The most severe judgement is not always what God does to us, but what He allows us to do without Him..
~~ Metaphor ~~
 The image is of a hand that has been holding a failing structure upright. When the hand is withdrawn, the collapse does not create the weakness; it reveals it.
~~ Quote ~~
 John Calvin observed that when God judges a people, He often does so by giving them over to themselves.
~~ Application ~~
 This confronts us with a sobering truth. Grace is not only what forgives; it is also what restrains. When God steps back, judgement has already begun. The most severe judgement is not sudden catastrophe, but unchecked self-rule, where God allows humanity to live fully inside the consequences of its own desires.

A World Diagnosed, Not Accused
Genesis 6:5
~~ Exegesis ~~
When you slow down and actually sit with Genesis 6:5, it’s an uncomfortable verse. Not dramatic in a cinematic way, but heavy. Relentless. God looks, and what He sees is not just bad behaviour stacking up, but a settled direction of the human heart. Every intention. Not some. Not most. Every one. And not occasionally, but continually.
This isn’t Scripture having a bad day or reaching for shock language. It’s not trying to win an argument. It’s simply telling us what happens when the inward bend introduced in Genesis 3 is allowed to run unchecked through generations. People still think, plan, imagine, invent. The image of God hasn’t vanished. But it’s all pointed the wrong way. Cleverness hasn’t disappeared, but it now serves self. Creativity hasn’t died, but it feeds corruption instead of worship.
And that’s the part that should bother us. The problem isn’t that humanity became empty or lifeless. It’s that it stayed energetic while losing its orientation. Nothing here suggests people stopped caring or desiring. They cared deeply. They desired constantly. They just desired without reference to God.
You could picture it like a compass that still spins freely. It hasn’t broken. It hasn’t frozen. But no matter how often you check it, it never points home. And after a while, you stop being surprised by how lost you are.
This verse isn’t accusing humanity of being as evil as possible. It’s diagnosing humanity as being wrong at the centre. Sin doesn’t mean we lack intention. It means our intentions no longer terminate in God. Left to ourselves, we don’t stall morally. We drift, and the drift has a direction.
That’s why Genesis 6 doesn’t feel exaggerated once you really listen to it. It feels so uncomfortably recognisable.
~~ Metaphor ~~
 The image is of a compass that still moves, but always points away from true north.
~~ Quote ~~
 R. C. Sproul explained that total depravity does not mean humanity is as bad as it could be, but that sin has extended to every faculty.
~~ Application ~
 Sin is not the absence of intention. It is intention aimed away from God. Our problem is not that we lack desire, but that our desires are disordered. Left to ourselves, we do not drift toward God. We drift away.
The Grief of a Holy God
Genesis 6:6–7
Exegesis
When Scripture says that God grieved, it’s not telling us that God was caught off guard or had second thoughts. This isn’t about God changing His mind in a human, emotional sense. It’s covenant language. It’s the Bible trying to describe what happens when a holy God stands face to face with a world saturated in corruption.
God’s grief matters because it shows that His opposition to sin isn’t cold or distant. He doesn’t observe violence and self-rule with some sort of detachment. But neither does judgement come from irritation or loss of control. It comes from incompatibility. A holy God cannot coexist peacefully with what destroys His creation.
Judgement, then, is not the absence of care. It is the painful expression of it.
Metaphor
 The image is of a master craftsman standing before a structure that can no longer bear weight. The grief is real, not because the builder failed, but because what was entrusted to care has been twisted beyond endurance.
Quote
 Geerhardus Vos wrote that the repentance of God signifies not a change in His eternal purpose, but a change in His dealings.
Application
 If our theology allows judgement but excludes grief, we have reduced God to an abstraction. Scripture presents a God whose holiness responds personally to corruption, and whose judgement is never separated from moral seriousness.
Grace Interrupts Total Collapse
Genesis 6:8-9
Exegesis
The story has reached what feels like the end of the line. Humanity is described in total terms, and nothing in the narrative suggests recovery. If things continue as they are, judgement isn’t just likely, it’s unavoidable.
And then the text turns. Quietly, almost abruptly: “But Noah found favour in the eyes of the LORD.” There’s no explanation attached to it. No defence. No list of reasons. The story doesn’t stop to tell us why God chose Noah. It simply tells us that He did.
Only afterwards, in Genesis 6:9, do we hear that Noah was righteous and walked with God. That’s true, but the order matters. Scripture doesn’t say Noah was righteous and therefore found favour. It says he found favour, and then describes the kind of life that flowed from it.
That protects us from turning Noah into a moral exception, the one good man who somehow saved himself. His obedience is real. His faithfulness matters. But neither is presented as the reason God intervened. Favour comes first. Righteousness follows.
That’s not a stylistic choice. It’s a theological guardrail. Even here, long before covenant or law, redemption is already operating on the logic of grace. God does not save because someone has earned it. He saves, and then shapes a life in response to that grace.
If grace were given as a reward for righteousness already achieved, it would stop being grace altogether. It would be wages. And Genesis is careful not to let us read the story that way.
Metaphor
 The image is not of a man climbing out of a pit, but of a hand reaching down into it. Noah does not distinguish himself in order to be saved. He is distinguished by grace to serve God’s saving purpose.
Quote
 Geerhardus Vos observed that grace does not assist fallen humanity, but interrupts it.
Application
Hope never rests on humanity recovering itself. It rests on God intervening when recovery is no longer possible. If grace depended on moral momentum, it would never arrive. It comes only when the illusion of self-rescue has been stripped away and God alone can act.
Salvation Through Judgement
Genesis 6:19
Exegesis
God commands Noah to bring representatives of living creatures into the ark in order to preserve life. The instruction is deliberate and comprehensive. Life is not preserved accidentally or selectively. It is preserved by divine intention. God names what will pass through the judgement and what will not.
The ark, therefore, is not an escape from judgement. It is salvation through judgement. There is one flood, one divine act, one event that encompasses the whole world. Scripture does not present multiple responses to sin, one gentle and one severe. There is a single response, and it is experienced differently depending on one’s relationship to God’s provision.
The difference lies not in the waters, but in whether one is inside the ark. The same flood that destroys the world lifts the vessel of refuge. The same judgement that brings death also carries life safely through. Salvation does not occur beside judgement, but within it.
This pattern will not disappear as Scripture unfolds. Again and again, God’s saving work moves through judgement rather than around it. Rescue is never found by avoiding God’s verdict, but by trusting the means He appoints. The ark does not cancel the flood. It bears its weight.
Metaphor
 The image is of a storm that destroys what is unanchored and carries the secured vessel safely to the other side.
Quote
 Edmund Clowney wrote that God saves His people not by removing judgement, but by carrying them safely through it.
Application
 Grace does not cancel judgement. It shelters from it. Salvation is never found by avoiding God’s verdict, but by trusting God’s provision.
Conclusion: Preservation, Not Reset
From the Ark to the Cross
Exegesis
The flood stops things getting worse, but it doesn’t fix what’s broken. When the waters go down, sin is still there. Death is still there. The same patterns start up again before long. Genesis is showing us something important here: judgement, even severe judgement, can’t remake the human heart. It can hold evil in check. It can preserve life. But it can’t give back what was lost in Eden.
That’s why the flood isn’t a reset button. God isn’t wiping the slate clean and starting again from scratch. He’s carrying the story forward. Noah isn’t a replacement Adam. He’s a link in the chain. History isn’t erased because redemption hasn’t happened yet.
So judgement doesn’t delay grace. It protects it. God restrains the world, not because humanity is healed, but because His promise must survive long enough to be fulfilled.
Metaphor
 The image is not of a fire extinguished completely, but of a wildfire brought under control. The flames are halted, not because the land is healed, but so that rebuilding can begin. Judgement contains destruction so that renewal remains possible.
Quote
 Augustine reminded the church that judgement restrains evil, but only grace renews the will. The flood restrains. It does not renew. Renewal must come another way.
Application
 The flood teaches us that judgement alone cannot save humanity, but without judgement humanity would destroy itself. God judges, and God preserves. He restrains evil, and He carries His promise forward through history.
And this is where the ark finally points beyond itself. It does not lead us back to Eden. It leads us forward to Christ. Once again, judgement and grace will meet. Not in water, but at a cross. There, judgement will not merely restrain sin, but deal with it. There, grace will not merely preserve life, but renew it.
The ark carried a remnant safely through the waters. Christ carries His people safely through judgement itself. And this time, the outcome is not preservation alone, but restoration. Not delay, but fulfilment. Not a guarded garden behind us, but a redeemed creation ahead.
The flood was not the end of the story.
 It was God ensuring that the gospel would have a future.
