Romans 16:1–16
The Lighthouse Crew of the Global Family
 Series: The Global Family of Faith

Introduction – Inside the Lighthouse of the Gospel
[Slide 1 – LighthouseCoastline]
 Painterly realism, dusk glow over the sea, lighthouse beam sweeping in warm gold, 16:9, no text.
Paul is reaching the final measures of his letter to the Romans. After soaring through the heights of doctrine in chapters 1 to 11 and descending into the practical realities of Christian living in chapters 12 to 15, he now brings us into the room where the gospel is lived out by real people. These names in Romans 16 are not afterthoughts. They are the living stones of the early church, the hands and feet of Christ’s mission.
If Romans is a lighthouse standing tall on the coastline of eternity, then chapter 16 is the logbook of the crew who kept its flame burning. It is not marble pillars or polished brass that maintain a lighthouse. It is a team of men and women working together, climbing the stairs, trimming the wick, polishing the glass, and carrying oil up the tower day after day.
This is the global family of faith.
 Different backgrounds.
 Different stories.
 One Light.
 One Christ.
 One mission.
Romans 16 is a portrait of what grace produces when it takes root in a community. So we climb the stairs of the lighthouse and open the logbook. We meet the crew who guarded the gospel flame on the coastline of Rome.

Text Reading – Romans 16:1–16

1. Phoebe: The Trusted Steward of the Lighthouse Manual (Rom 16:1–2)
Text:
 “I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a servant of the church at Cenchreae, that you may welcome her in the Lord in a way worthy of the saints and help her in whatever she may need from you, for she has been a patron of many and of myself as well.”
[Slide 3 – PhoebeCoastPath]
Paul begins his greetings with Phoebe. This alone tells us something. The first name in the Holy Spirit’s list of gospel workers is not an apostle, not a preacher, not a teacher, but a woman whose life was marked by faithfulness. Paul calls her a servant, diakonos, a recognised worker in the church at Cenchreae, the harbour town beside Corinth.
Most scholars agree that she likely carried this Roman letter from Corinth to Rome. Imagine that. One woman, travelling the ancient roads alone, entrusted with the theological heart of Christianity. No guards. No entourage. Just courage, devotion, and the weight of responsibility for the gospel.
Paul also identifies her as a patron, someone who used her resources to support others. Her generosity strengthened the church. Her life was open-handed, her ministry life-giving. And so Paul commands the Romans to welcome her, honour her, and help her, because those who carry gospel burdens should never carry them alone.
Lighthouse Metaphor – Keeper of the Logbook
In every lighthouse there is a logbook, the essential manual containing weather reports, maintenance notes, and instructions for survival. Lose that, and the lighthouse becomes dangerous. Someone must carry the manual, protect it, and deliver it safely.
Phoebe is the keeper of the logbook. She walks the coastline carrying the very document that explains the gospel’s light. She is unseen by most, but without her the tower would be without its guidance. She is the steward of the flame, the one who ensures that truth reaches those who need it.
Quote
J. I. Packer wrote, “Faithfulness in small things is the foundation of great spiritual strength.” Phoebe’s strength was quiet, steady, and indispensable.
Application
Phoebe asks each of us: What has God placed in your hands? You may not preach. You may not lead. But the gospel advances through those who faithfully carry the responsibilities God entrusts to them. Honour those who serve quietly. Support those who bear burdens. And serve Christ with faithfulness, not for recognition but for His glory.

2. Priscilla and Aquila: The Courageous Co-Labourers (Rom 16:3–5)
Text:
 “Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus, who risked their necks for my life, to whom not only I give thanks but all the churches of the Gentiles give thanks as well. Greet also the church in their house.”
[Slide 4 – LanternRoomStorm]
 A husband and wife fastening shutters and tending the light in a storm, 16:9.
Priscilla and Aquila appear repeatedly in the New Testament. They discipled Apollos. They travelled with Paul. They opened their home to the church. They used their livelihood as tentmakers to support mission work. They are the couple whose marriage was wrapped around the work of Christ.
Paul says they risked their necks for him. This is not metaphorical poetry. These two literally placed themselves in danger, perhaps shielding Paul from an angry mob or intervening when his life was threatened. The early church did not grow by convenience or casual involvement. It grew through courageous men and women whose love for Christ outweighed their fear.
Lighthouse Metaphor – Storm Workers
When storms hit the coastline, someone must climb the tower, secure the lantern room, and keep the flame alive. It is dangerous work. But if the flame dies, sailors perish.
Priscilla and Aquila are the storm workers. They stand in the wind and waves to keep the gospel shining. Their marriage becomes a ministry partnership. Their home becomes a beacon. Their courage strengthens the entire Roman coastline of the early church.
Quote
R. C. Sproul once said, “The most dangerous place to be is outside the will of God, and the safest place is in the centre of it.” Priscilla and Aquila lived in the centre of God’s will, even when it took them into danger.
Application
Is your home available for the work of Christ? Do you see your marriage as a team for the gospel? Courage in the church is not loud. It is steady, sacrificial, and willing to step into difficulty for the sake of others. Ask: Where does Christ call me to stand firm for the good of His people?

3. Epaenetus, Mary, and the Firstfruits of Labour (Rom 16:5b–8)
Text:
 “Greet my beloved Epaenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in Asia. Greet Mary, who has worked hard for you. Greet Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord.”
[Slide 5 – FirstFlameIgnition]
Paul now brings us into the early days of gospel work. Epaenetus was the first convert in Asia, the first spark of revival in a region that would later shine brightly with churches like Ephesus, Smyrna, and Laodicea. Firstfruits carry hope. They point forward to a harvest not yet seen.
Then there is Mary, who worked hard for the church. Paul uses a word that describes exhausting labour, the kind that drains the body but fills the soul. Mary was not in the spotlight. She was not preaching or travelling. But the kingdom advanced because people like Mary kept serving when others rested.
Ampliatus, whose name was common among slaves, is described as beloved in the Lord. The Roman church included aristocrats and servants, Jews and Gentiles, men and women, side by side in Christ.
Lighthouse Metaphor – First Light and Daily Workers
When a lighthouse is built, the first lighting of the flame is momentous. One spark becomes a beam. But after that moment, the daily labour begins. Someone must trim the wick, clean the glass, carry the oil, and climb the stairs.
Epaenetus is the first spark. Mary and others are the daily workers who keep the flame burning. The church needs both the moments of breakthrough and the routine of faithfulness.
Quote
Matthew Henry wrote, “Those who do the most for Christ are often they who are least seen.” Mary’s work was hidden, but heaven noticed.
Application
Do not despise small beginnings. Do not overlook routine faithfulness. God builds His kingdom through firstfruits and faithful workers alike. Ask: How can I strengthen the flame God has lit? Who can I encourage to keep going when they feel unseen?
4. Andronicus and Junia: The Storm-Tested Keepers (Rom 16:7–12)
Text:
 “Greet Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners. They are well known to the apostles, and they were in Christ before me... Greet Apelles, who is approved in Christ... Greet those workers in the Lord, Tryphaena and Tryphosa.”
[Slide 6 – LighthouseStormShelter]
Andronicus and Junia are believers with deep history. They were in Christ before Paul, meaning they belonged to the earliest generation of Jewish Christians. They had been imprisoned for the gospel. Their scars were their credentials. They were respected by the apostles themselves.
Paul also mentions Apelles, “approved in Christ,” a phrase meaning tested and proven genuine. And the workers Tryphaena and Tryphosa, whose names suggest noble birth, are tireless in their service.
This entire section shows us believers who have endured hardship for Christ. These are the saints whose perseverance keeps the church steady.
Lighthouse Metaphor – Storm Veterans
Every lighthouse crew includes veterans who know what it means to stand when the tower shakes. When the waves crash and the wind howls, these keepers do not run. Their stability becomes the anchor for the younger crew.
Andronicus and Junia are storm veterans. They have endured imprisonment, hardship, opposition, and loneliness. Their faith was not theoretical. It was storm-tested. Their perseverance fortified the Roman church.
Quote
Martyn Lloyd-Jones said, “A faith that has never been tested is a faith that cannot be trusted.” These believers were tested, and their faith proved real.
Application
Your perseverance strengthens others. Your endurance during hardship becomes a testimony. Ask: How is God using my storms to strengthen someone else’s faith? Do not underestimate the power of standing firm under pressure. God uses storm-tested saints to steady the entire lighthouse.

5. The Diverse Family and the Holy Kiss (Rom 16:13–16)
Text:
 “Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord, also his mother, who has been a mother to me as well... Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas... Greet one another with a holy kiss.”
[Slide 7 – DiverseCrewAroundLantern]
The final greetings showcase the diversity and beauty of the early church. Rufus may well be the son of Simon of Cyrene, the man who carried Jesus’ cross. If so, his mother became a spiritual mother to Paul himself.
There are names common among slaves and names common among the elite. There are Jews and Gentiles, families and single believers, men and women, all united in Christ.
Paul ends with “Greet one another with a holy kiss,” a cultural expression of affection, unity, reconciliation, and family. This was not a romantic gesture but a sign that believers belonged to one another in Christ.
Lighthouse Metaphor – One Crew, One Light
A lighthouse crew is never made of one type of person. Engineers, cleaners, cooks, signalmen, watchmen, all different, all necessary. Their diversity strengthens the tower.
The Roman church was a diverse crew shining one light into a dark empire. Their unity was visible, warm, affectionate, family-like. They loved one another in Christ.
Quote
John Owen wrote, “The church is the society of those whom Christ has chosen, united in His love and bound together by His Spirit.” This is exactly what we see in this passage.
Application
Celebrate the diversity of God’s people. Embrace unity. Show affection and honour. Ask: Who needs my welcome today? Who needs encouragement? The world sees the gospel when the lighthouse crew stands together as one family.

The Gospel Connection
[Slide 8 – LighthouseSaviour]
The Light of the world entered our storm.
 He faced the darkness that should have consumed us.
 He bore the waves of judgement that would have destroyed us.
 And He brought us into His lighthouse of grace.
At the cross, He ignited the light that will never go out.
 Through His resurrection, He placed that light into the hands of His people.
 Through His Spirit, He gathers a global crew to shine His truth into the world.
No one is too broken to be part of this lighthouse.
 No one too far gone to be welcomed.
 Christ stands at the door of the tower and calls us into the light.
Call to Action
[Slide 9 – LighthouseCall]
To the faithful servant:
 Your hidden work strengthens the tower.
To the storm-weathered saint:
 Your endurance steadies the crew.
To the hesitant believer:
 Your place in the lighthouse matters. Take it.
To the unbeliever:
 Step out of the darkness. Come into the light of Christ.
 He welcomes you into His family and His mission.

Final Thoughts
[Slide 10 – LanternAndScripture]
Romans 16 shows us the heart of the global family of faith:
 faithful stewards, courageous couples, firstfruits of grace, storm-tested believers, and a diverse family united in Christ.
One lighthouse.
 One light.
 One global crew.
 One Saviour.
May we shine as they did, keeping the gospel flame bright in our generation.
