Sermon 3 – Genesis 3
The Fall and the First Gospel
 Protoevangelium: Promise of the Seed
Introduction: From Faithful Dependence to Fractured Trust
Genesis 2 ended with humanity unashamed.
 Nothing hidden. Nothing feared. Nothing fractured.
Humanity lived as it was created to live: dependent on God’s word, sustained by God’s breath, and secure within God’s order. Image-bearing was not independence, but faithful reception.
Genesis 3 does not introduce a new story. It breaks the one we have just seen.
The garden remains. God’s command still stands. Humanity’s vocation is not revoked. What changes is humanity’s relationship to God’s word. Trust is replaced by suspicion. Dependence is exchanged for autonomy.
And yet, Genesis 3 is not only the chapter where death enters the world. It is also the chapter where God speaks hope into the wreckage. Before humanity can ask for rescue, God announces that rescue is coming.
The fall is real. But it is not final.

 1: The Serpent Undermines the Word of God
Genesis 3:1
~~ Exegesis ~~
 The serpent is described as crafty. The term does not suggest chaos or irrational evil, but calculated subtlety. This is deception that works from inside the structure God has made.
The serpent’s first words are not a denial of God’s existence, nor an outright contradiction of God’s command. They are a question. “Did God actually say?” The strategy is not to remove God’s word, but to destabilise confidence in it.
Notice the distortion. God’s command was generous, abundant, and clear. The serpent reframes it as restrictive and severe. God’s goodness is obscured. His authority is placed under suspicion.
This is a direct assault on image-bearing humanity. Genesis 2 taught us that humanity lives by receiving God’s word. To undermine that word is to attack the foundation of human life.
Adam’s silence is critical. He was placed in the garden to work and to guard it. That guarding was not merely physical. It was theological. To guard sacred space was to guard the truth spoken within it. His silence is not neutrality. It is failure.
~~ Quote ~~
 “Satan never begins by telling us that God is false, but that He is unreliable.”
 John Owen
~~  Metaphor ~~
 A blueprint is questioned before a single wall is moved.
~~  Application ~~
Temptation rarely begins by rejecting Scripture. It begins by reshaping God’s word until it no longer governs trust.

 2: God’s Command Is Rewritten
Genesis 3:2–5
~~ Exegesis ~~
 The woman’s reply shows that God’s word is still known, but it is already being reshaped. God’s generosity is shortened. The prohibition is expanded. Precision is lost.
The serpent then denies the consequence outright. “You will not surely die.” This is not simply a falsehood. It is theology. Death is presented as an empty threat. Obedience is rendered unnecessary.
What is offered instead is autonomy. “You will be like God.” Not likeness by reflection, but likeness by independence. The creature is invited to become the arbiter of good and evil.
Genesis 2 defined image-bearing as dependence lived rightly before God. Genesis 3 offers an alternative anthropology: humanity as self-defining, self-authorising, and self-sustaining.
~~ Quote ~~
 “The essence of sin is the attempt to live without reference to God.”
 Herman Bavinck
~~  Metaphor ~~
 A tenant begins to question whether the owner understands the house.
~~  Application ~~
 Every act of sin contains a theology. It always says something about who God is and who we think we are.

~*~ The Nature of Human Choice at the Point of the Fall ~*~
Before we move into the act itself, we need to be clear about what kind of choosing is taking place here.
Genesis 2 shows that Adam receives a command from God. He hears it. He understands it. He is not coerced. When Adam eats, he does so willingly. This is a real choice, and Scripture never denies that.
But Genesis is equally careful not to let us assume that this moment defines human ability forever.
Adam’s choice in the garden is unique. Not because it is the only time a human being chooses, but because it is the only time a human being chooses without sin already shaping the will.
Adam is created upright. His desires are ordered. His trust has not yet been fractured. His will is free in the sense that it is not yet enslaved to corruption. He can obey or disobey without internal distortion. That is precisely why the command matters, and why the fall is catastrophic rather than trivial.
Once this act occurs, something changes permanently.
Humanity does not lose the will. Scripture never suggests that. Humans continue to choose, to plan, to desire, and to act. What is lost is moral freedom. The will becomes bound to a fallen nature. From this point on, human choice is real, but it is no longer neutral.
Genesis 3 is not teaching that all humans in all times possess the same moral ability Adam had in this moment. Genesis 3 is explaining why they do not.
This distinction matters because it guards us from misunderstanding what happens next. The act we are about to witness is not merely a bad decision among many possible alternatives. It is the moment in which humanity’s capacity to choose God without distortion is lost.
From here on, history will be shaped not simply by human decisions, but by the consequences of this one.
And it is in that unfallen moment, with a will still capable of trust, that Adam reaches for what was never given.

 3: Seizing What Was Never Given
Genesis 3:6
~~ Exegesis ~~
 “The woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise.”
The text is careful and deliberate. Three evaluations are listed, and each one corresponds to something genuinely good within God’s created order. Food sustains life. Beauty delights the senses. Wisdom is necessary for faithful rule. None of these desires are sinful in themselves. Genesis has already affirmed that creation is good, that food is a gift, and that wisdom is part of humanity’s calling.
The problem is not desire. The problem is direction.
What God had established as a gift to be received in trust is now assessed independently and seized autonomously. The movement is subtle but decisive. The creature evaluates reality apart from God’s word and acts on that evaluation. The act is no longer responsive obedience, but self-authorising judgement.
This is why the act cannot be reduced to simple disobedience. It is fundamental rebellion. Humanity claims the right to determine good and evil on its own terms. The fruit is taken not because God is absent, but because His authority is set aside.
Adam’s presence intensifies the tragedy. The text gives no indication that he is deceived. He is silent, watchful, and compliant. The one charged with guarding sacred space allows the intrusion to proceed unchecked. The verbs used earlier in Genesis 2 to describe Adam’s calling, to serve and to guard, now stand in sharp contrast to his inaction.
This is not merely personal failure. It is a vocational collapse.
Adam doesn’t simply break a command. He abandons his office. The priest of Eden allows a rival voice to shape the environment entrusted to him. The fall is therefore not only moral, but representative. Adam acts not merely as an individual, but as humanity’s head.(federal)
Humanity does not simply fall from innocence. Humanity relinquishes its God-given role as faithful image-bearer. Authority is ceded. The garden is breached from within.
~~ Quote ~~
 “Adam did not merely sin; he surrendered his calling.” - G. K. Beale
~~  Metaphor ~~
 The watchman does not scale the wall or force the gate. He stands at his post, hears a foreign voice, and does nothing. The gate is not broken open. It is unlatched. The danger enters not through overpowering force, but through permitted access. What destroys the city is not the strength of the enemy, but the failure of someone appointed to guard it.
~~  Application ~~
 Silence in the presence of falsehood is never neutral. When God’s word is questioned and truth is reframed, inaction is itself a choice. To refuse to speak is not to preserve peace, but to surrender responsibility. Every calling God gives includes a duty to guard what He has entrusted. When that duty is abandoned, disorder does not remain outside. It enters and reshapes the space from within.

 4: Shame Enters the Human Experience
Genesis 3:7–10
~~ Exegesis ~~  
 “The eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked.”
The serpent’s promise appears, at first glance, to be fulfilled. The eyes are opened. But what they see is not wisdom, insight, or moral clarity. They see nakedness. Awareness comes, but it is the awareness of exposure rather than enlightenment.
This is the first time Scripture names shame, and it is crucial to note how it enters. Shame is not spoken by God. It is not imposed as a sentence. It arises immediately from within the human pair. Exposure becomes unbearable because trust has collapsed. Where Genesis 2 described nakedness without shame, Genesis 3 shows nakedness transformed into vulnerability, and vulnerability into fear.
Shame is therefore not merely emotional discomfort. It is a covenantal condition. It signals that something fundamental has ruptured in humanity’s relationship with God, with one another, and within the self. What was once openness becomes threat. What was once safety becomes danger.
The sewing of fig leaves is humanity’s first religious act. It is an attempt to manage exposure, to control perception, to repair internally what has been broken covenantally. Covering replaces confession. Self-protection replaces trust.
When God calls, “Where are you?” the question is not for information. God does not lack location data. This is covenantal language. It is the voice of relationship seeking response. It is the same kind of question a parent asks a hiding child, not to discover whereabouts, but to invite return.
Humanity responds not with confession, but with fear. “I was afraid.” Fear replaces freedom. Hiding replaces fellowship. The rupture is now complete.
~~ Quote ~~
 “Shame is the inward echo of lost communion.”
 Sinclair Ferguson
~~  Metaphor ~~
 A house once filled with light now shutters its windows. Nothing outside has changed. The sun still shines. The threat is not external. It is internal. The occupants close themselves in, not because the house is unsafe, but because they no longer trust the space they inhabit. What was built for openness is now used for concealment.
~~  Application ~~
 We hide not because God has become unsafe, but because we are no longer at peace with ourselves. Shame teaches us to manage appearances rather than seek restoration. It trains us to cover instead of confess, to withdraw instead of draw near. And because shame feels protective, it is easily mistaken for wisdom. But Scripture shows us that hiding does not heal the rupture. It only confirms it. The question God asks still stands, not as accusation, but as invitation: “Where are you?”

 5: Responsibility Is Deflected
Genesis 3:11–13
~~ Exegesis ~~
 God’s questions continue. “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?” These are not interrogations designed to extract information. God knows the facts. They are invitations to confession. The structure of the questions narrows responsibility and opens a path for truth to be spoken.
That path is refused.
Adam’s response is revealing. He does not deny the act, but he reframes responsibility. “The woman whom you gave to be with me.” The blame moves laterally and upward at the same time. The woman is implicated, and God Himself is subtly accused. Adam’s words do more than explain behaviour. They defend identity. Guilt is displaced in order to preserve the self.
The woman’s response follows the same pattern. She does not deny eating, but she redirects responsibility. “The serpent deceived me.” The serpent is named accurately, but confession is still withheld. Explanation replaces repentance.
This is the relational logic of the fall. Humanity becomes capable of telling the truth about events while remaining evasive about culpability/resonsibility. Language is no longer used to restore communion, but to manage exposure.
This is why Scripture treats self-justification as spiritually lethal. It does not merely excuse sin. It blocks the possibility of healing. Where responsibility is displaced, repentance cannot occur. And where repentance is absent, restoration is impossible.
What began as distrust of God’s word now matures into distrust of God’s character. God is no longer addressed as the one who can restore, but as the one who must be defended against.
This is the inheritance of the fall. Humanity becomes skilled at explanation and resistant to repentance.
~~ Quote ~~
 “Self-justification is the final refuge of fallen humanity.” - Karl Barth
~~  Metaphor ~~
 Cracks spread when no one will name the fault. The structure does not collapse all at once. Instead, pressure is redistributed. Blame is shifted from beam to beam, wall to wall, until the whole house is compromised. What might have been repaired through honest exposure is allowed to fracture further through denial and deflection.
~~  Application ~~
 Repentance begins where self-defence ends. As long as the self must be protected at all costs, truth will be negotiated rather than confessed. Scripture does not call us to perfect explanations, but to honest acknowledgement. God’s questions are not traps. They are invitations. And the path back to restoration always begins when responsibility is owned rather than redirected.

 6: The Protoevangelium
Genesis 3:14–15
~~ Exegesis ~~
 God addresses the serpent first. This is deliberate. Judgement is pronounced, but embedded within judgement is promise.
What matters first is who acts.
“I will put enmity.”
This is not descriptive language. God is not observing an existing hostility between humanity and the serpent. He is creating it. The initiative is entirely divine.
Left to itself, fallen humanity would not naturally oppose the deceiver. The text does not say that the woman chooses enmity, or that humanity resolves to resist. God Himself intervenes and establishes hostility. Conflict with evil is not humanity’s instinctive posture. It is God’s gracious interruption.
This immediately clarifies the condition of humanity after the fall. Human beings still act, still choose, still desire, but they do not autonomously realign themselves toward God. If reconciliation were possible through unassisted human choice, there would be no need for God to impose enmity. Instruction would suffice. Warning would suffice. Appeal would suffice.
Instead, God acts.
The conflict is framed in terms of seed. History is now structured, not by human moral improvement, but by divine promise. The seed is both collective and singular. A line will continue through history, and that line will culminate in a representative individual who stands for humanity.
The asymmetry is crucial. The serpent bruises the heel. The seed crushes the head. The victory is costly, but it is decisive. Suffering is real, but defeat is not shared.
This is the first gospel, not because it explains everything, but because it establishes everything. Salvation will come through divine initiative, representative obedience, suffering, and final triumph. All of this is spoken before law, covenant, or sacrifice are introduced.
The text does not point us toward humanity choosing its way back to God. It points us toward God acting to bring humanity back to Himself.
~~ Quote ~~
 “Grace does not assist fallen humanity; it interrupts it.” - Geerhardus Vos
~~  Metaphor ~~
 The builder does not wait for the occupants to repair the damage. He steps in and secures the structure Himself.
~~  Application ~~
 Hope does not rest on humanity recovering what was lost through better choices. It rests on God doing what humanity cannot. From this point on, redemption will move forward not by human resolve, but by divine promise fulfilled in time.

 7: Judgement as Disordered Continuation
Genesis 3:16–19
~~ Exegesis ~~
 God now addresses the woman and the man directly. What is striking is that the basic structures established in Genesis 2 are not removed. Marriage remains. Work remains. Humanity remains embodied and situated within creation. Judgement does not abolish creation. It bends it.
Pain enters relationship. The language is not simply physical suffering, but relational strain. What was created as corresponding partnership is now marked by tension, struggle, and imbalance. Love remains, but it is no longer effortless. Unity persists, but it is contested from within.
Frustration enters labour. Work itself is not cursed. The ground is. The vocation to cultivate and keep remains, but it is now met with resistance. Thorns and thistles are not merely agricultural details. They are signs of disorder within creation, no longer yielding easily to human rule. Dominion is frustrated because the one appointed to exercise it has rebelled against the Creator.
Death enters existence. “You are dust, and to dust you shall return.” This is not arbitrary punishment. It is the inevitable consequence of severed dependence. Humanity was never self-sustaining. Life was always received. Once trust is broken, mortality becomes certain.
Creation itself is implicated. The ground shares in humanity’s fall because humanity was placed as its steward. When the image-bearer fractures, the sphere entrusted to him fractures as well. The world groans not because it is defective, but because it has been pulled out of alignment.
Judgement, then, is not God acting against creation, but God naming what life becomes when lived apart from His sustaining order. God does not introduce chaos. He permits humanity to experience the internal consequences of rejecting His design.
~~ Quote ~~
 “The curse is creation bent, not creation undone.”
 Cornelius Van Til
~~  Metaphor ~~
 A structure still stands, but every beam groans. The walls have not collapsed, and the foundations remain in place, but the weight is no longer distributed as it was designed to be. Stress appears where there was once ease. What once supported life effortlessly now resists it. The problem is not that the structure exists, but that it no longer bears weight as it should.
~~  Application ~~
 The brokenness of the world is moral before it is mechanical. Creation does not malfunction randomly. It reflects a deeper disorder rooted in human rebellion. Pain, frustration, and decay are not meaningless accidents. They are signals that something has gone wrong at the level of trust and obedience. And because the disorder is moral, it cannot be fixed by technique alone. What is bent requires restoration, not merely repair.

 8: Exile with Mercy
Genesis 3:20–24
~~ Exegesis ~~
 The chapter does not end with silence or annihilation. Life continues.
Adam names the woman Eve, “the mother of all living.” This act is easy to miss, but it matters. Naming is an act of faith. In the midst of judgement and loss, Adam speaks in hope. Death has been announced, yet life will continue. The future is not closed. The promise spoken earlier is already beginning to shape human response.
God then acts again. “The LORD God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins and clothed them.” This is God’s answer to the fig leaves. Humanity attempted to manage shame through self-made covering. God replaces that with a covering He provides. The text is understated, but the implication is clear. Blood is shed. A life is given so that shame may be covered. Substitution appears quietly, without explanation or ceremony. Scripture does not yet teach sacrifice formally, but it shows it.
This covering is not cosmetic. It addresses the rupture itself. Shame is not overcome by concealment, but by God’s provision. Humanity does not clothe itself acceptably. God must do it.
Exile follows. Humanity is sent out of the garden, not because God delights in separation, but because eternal life in a fallen state would be catastrophic. The expulsion is not vindictive. It is merciful restraint. To eat from the tree of life while corrupted would be to fix death permanently.
The way back is guarded. Cherubim and a flaming sword stand watch. Access to life is no longer open. Redemption will not come through return by human effort. God Himself will have to open the way again, in His time and by His means.
Exile, then, is not the abandonment of God’s purpose. It is the means by which that purpose is preserved.
~~ Quote ~~
 “Grace governs even exile.” - Geerhardus Vos
~~  Metaphor ~~
 The house is closed, but the architect remains. The doors are shut, not because the project has failed, but because the structure cannot yet bear re-entry. Repairs are planned. Restoration is intended. The closure is temporary, governed by wisdom rather than rejection.
~~  Application ~~
 God’s judgement never cancels His purpose. When God bars a way forward, it is not because hope has ended, but because hope must come another way. Loss, restriction, and waiting are not signs of abandonment. They are often signs that God is protecting His promise until it can be fulfilled rightly. Exile is painful, but it is not pointless. Even outside Eden, God remains committed to what He has made.
Conclusion: The Seed Who Enters the Ruin
Genesis 3 explains why the world is broken.
 It names the fracture honestly, without softening the cost. Trust is lost. Shame enters. Death becomes inevitable. Exile follows.
But Genesis 3 also explains why the world will not remain so.
The image is fractured, but it is not erased. God still addresses humanity. Still clothed by God. Still named and sustained by God. The calling is broken, but it is not revoked. Work continues. Relationship continues. History continues. The house is damaged, but it is not abandoned. The builder does not walk away.
Instead, God speaks.
 Into judgement, He speaks promise.
 Into collapse, He speaks purpose.
 Into exile, He speaks life.
The seed will come, not as an idea, not as a principle, but as a person. He will enter the same world that fell, not from a distance, but from within. He will not bypass suffering. He will be bruised. The serpent will strike His heel. Obedience will cost Him everything.
But the outcome is not in doubt.
He will crush the serpent. Not by avoiding death, but by passing through it. Not by reclaiming Eden, but by opening a greater way to life. The guarded tree will not remain closed forever. The promise spoken in Eden will move through history until the way is opened again.
This is where the contrasts finally settle.
Where Adam failed to guard, Christ will stand firm.
 Where Adam grasped at autonomy, Christ will entrust Himself fully to the Father.
 Where Adam hid in fear and shame, Christ will be exposed publicly, bearing what Adam unleashed.
And in doing so, Christ does not merely reverse Adam’s failure. He fulfils humanity’s calling. He becomes the true image-bearer, the faithful priest, the obedient Son.
That is why the gospel does not begin in Bethlehem or at Calvary. Those moments matter, but they are not the beginning. The gospel is spoken in Eden, before humanity understands the depth of its loss. From the moment of the fall, God refuses to let failure have the final word.
So Genesis 3 is not only the chapter where humanity falls.
 It is the chapter where God declares that the fall will not be the end.
The seed has been promised.
 The conflict has been defined.
 The outcome has been assured.
And the rest of Scripture is the story of that promise walking toward its fulfilment, until the serpent is crushed, shame is covered, and life is restored.
