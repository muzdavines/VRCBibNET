**Intro: The First Foundation Stone**
Slide 1: In the beginning God
 -- Exegesis --
 Genesis begins like the sound of the first spade breaking earth. No preface, no warm-up, no explanation, just a declaration that sets the world straight. Scripture opens with God as the subject, and everything else as the result. That opening move is already Christological, because the New Testament tells us that the Father creates through the Son. So when Genesis says God creates, we are not meant to imagine a distant deity and a separate Christ who arrives later. The Son is present at the beginning as the eternal Word through whom the work is done. Genesis is not merely the start of the Bible’s story, it is the setting of the load-bearing reality on which everything else rests.
 -- Quote --
 “The world is not self-explanatory. It is God-explanatory.” - R.C. Sproul
 -- Metaphor --
 Before you see walls, you see lines. Before you see rooms, you see foundations. Nobody builds a house by starting with curtains. You start with what will carry the weight. Genesis 1 is God laying the first foundation stone of truth, and that stone is this: God is, and God acts, and the world is His workmanship, built through His Son.
 Application
 If you start anywhere else, you end up living in a house with no foundations. You will interpret life by your feelings, your fears, your culture, your wounds. Genesis says, start with God, and then you will know what everything else is, including you.
-
So we stand at the trench line, looking down into the first foundations. Nothing is built yet, but everything is being decided. And before the first stone is laid, we remember who the builder is. This house will not rest on our opinions or our strength. It will rest on God, and it will be raised through Christ.
1In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. 2 The earth was bwithout form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.
3 And God said, c“Let there be light,” and there was light. 4 And God saw that the light was good. And God separated the light from the darkness. 5 God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day.

6 And God said, d“Let there be an expanse1 in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.” 7 And God made 2 the expanse and separated the waters that were under the expanse from the waters that were above the expanse. And it was so. 8 And God called the expanse Heaven.3 And there was evening and there was morning, the second day.
9 And God said, g“Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear.” And it was so. 10 God called the dry land Earth,4 and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.
28 And God blessed them. And God said to them, s“Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” 29 And God said, “Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit. You shall have them for food. 30 And uto every beast of the earth and to every bird of the heavens and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so. 31 vAnd God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.
2 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and wall the host of them. 2 And xon the seventh day God finished his work that he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done. 3 So God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God rested from all his work that he had done in creation.

** The Builder Exists Before the House **
Genesis 1:1: In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
 -- Exegesis --
 “In the beginning” is not a date on a calendar. It is the creation of the calendar. Time begins when God begins to create. God does not arrive inside the universe, because the universe arrives because of God. The verb “created” signals divine initiative, not divine response. The phrase “the heavens and the earth” is a comprehensive sweep, everything above and below, everything seen and unseen. Now bring in the New Testament lens without forcing it. Paul tells us that “all things were created… through him and for him.” That means Genesis 1:1 is already telling us that the Father’s creative work is carried out through the Son. Christ is not part of the house’s furniture, He is the one through whom the house comes into existence.
 -- Quote --
 “Before the world was, God was. And the Son was with Him.”
 Herman Bavinck
 -- Metaphor --
 Imagine arriving at a building site and finding not an empty plot, but nothing at all. No land, no sky, no space to stand in. Then the builder speaks, and the plot appears, the horizon appears, the very dimensions you need for building appear. The builder existed before the site. The house belongs to the builder. Ownership is settled before construction begins.
 Application
 This confronts pride and it comforts anxiety. Pride, because you are not the owner of reality. Anxiety, because the house is not held together by your effort. If Christ is the agent of creation, then your life is not an accident drifting in a purposeless universe. It is lived inside a world made through Him and for Him.
-
So before we even talk about walls and rooms, we settle the first truth. The builder existed before the site. The house belongs to Him. And because the Father creates through the Son, Christ is not a later visitor to this story. He is there at the beginning, the one through whom the foundation of reality is laid.

The House Rises by the Word
Genesis 1:3–25 (the repeated “And God said”)
 -- Exegesis --
 Genesis 1 is structured by speech. “And God said” is the rhythm of creation. The Word of God is not commentary on a world already there, it is the cause of the world being there. When God says “Let there be light,” light does not deliberate, it appears. This is where Christology belongs naturally, because John identifies the eternal Word, and Paul identifies the Son as the one “through” whom all things were made. So the speech of Genesis is not merely sound waves in the air, it is divine command enacted through the Son, the living Word. Creation obeys because creation recognises its Maker.
 -- Quote --
 “God’s Word is the instrument of His power.”  John Calvin
 -- Metaphor --
 On a building site, words can be cheap, unless the one speaking has authority. But when the master builder speaks, the site moves. Beams are lifted, lines are checked, walls go up. Genesis shows us the ultimate site, the world itself, responding to the voice of the builder. The Son is not merely repeating the Father’s plans, He is the Word through whom the plans become reality.
– Application –
 If Christ is the creative Word, then His word is not optional for discipleship. You cannot treat Scripture as an accessory and expect the structure of your life to stand. Many believers want the comforts of the house without the obedience of the blueprint. Genesis teaches you that stability comes from hearing and heeding the Word that built the world.
-
And now the build begins to rise. The builder speaks, and structure appears. Lines become form, and form becomes order. The house comes into being by the Word, and that Word is not merely a sound, but the Son. If Christ is the Word through whom the house is built, then His voice is the one we must learn to trust and obey.

Christ Is the Master Builder and the Goal of the House
Colossians 1:16–17 guiding Genesis 1
16 For by[a] him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him. 17 And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together.
 -- Exegesis --
 Paul says “by him all things were created… all things were created through him and for him.” This is not poetry alone, it is ontology. It tells you what creation is. It is Christ-originated, Christ-mediated, Christ-directed. Paul even adds the unseen realm, “thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities.” Whatever spiritual powers exist, they are not ultimate, because they are created things. Then he adds, “in him all things hold together.” Creation is not only built through Christ, it is held in being through Christ. Genesis shows construction. Colossians shows both construction and ongoing structural integrity.
 -- Quote --
 “Creation is not a stage on which Christ appears. It is a house built for Him.” Sinclair Ferguson
 -- Metaphor --
 Some people treat Jesus as the emergency repairman called in when the house is already falling down. Paul says no. Christ is the architect, the builder, and the purpose of the house. He is the reason the house exists, and He is the one who keeps the house from collapsing.
 Application
 This corrects a thin/skinny/anemic Christianity. Christ is not only the answer to your guilt, He is the meaning of your existence. That changes how you see work, rest, the body, time, and suffering. The aim of your life is not merely to cope until heaven. The aim is to live for the One for whom all things were made.
-
And here the blueprint becomes unmistakable. This is Christ’s house. Built through Him, built for Him, held together by Him. He is not simply the answer to our problems inside the house, He is the reason the house exists at all. Every beam points to Him, every room belongs to Him, and every breath we take is sustained by His hand.


4: The Spirit Oversees the Work Christ Builds
Genesis 1:2
 -- Exegesis --
 “The earth was without form and void.” That is not moral evil, it is unfinished structure. “Darkness was over the face of the deep.” Then, “the Spirit of God was hovering.” The Spirit’s hovering is purposeful presence, like watchful oversight before order emerges. Now tie the Christological thread correctly. The Spirit does not work independently of the Son. The Spirit completes what the Father wills through the Son. In creation, the Father speaks, the Son is the mediating Word, the Spirit brings order and life. This is not later doctrine imposed on Genesis, it is later revelation clarifying what Genesis is already showing.
 -- Quote --
 “The Spirit is the perfecter of God’s work.”
 Basil the Great
 -- Metaphor --
 Early on a site, everything looks like mess. Trenches, mud, stacks of materials. An untrained eye thinks nothing is happening. But the foreman is there, watching, directing, ensuring that what is hidden will become stable. The Spirit hovering tells you the work is under supervision, and the design will reach completion.
 Application
 This is hope for the unfinished parts of your life. If the Spirit hovered over an unformed world and brought it toward beauty and fullness, then your chaos does not mean God has left. The same Spirit who brought created order now brings redeemed order, shaping believers into the likeness of Christ. 
- 
If you have ever watched the early stages of a build, you know it can look like chaos before it looks like a home. But the foreman is there, overseeing every stage. The Spirit hovers, not as a distant observer, but as God’s active presence, completing what the Father wills through the Son. This house is not drifting into order, it is being brought into order.

5: The House Is Signed Off as Very Good, and It Belongs to Christ
Genesis 1:31
 -- Exegesis --
 “And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good.” God evaluates His work. Creation is not an accident that happens to function. It is a deliberate design that delights its Maker. This verdict comes before sin, which matters because it means the created order is not inherently bad. Now connect Christ. If all things were created through Christ, then the goodness of creation is not independent of Christ. The house is good because it is built through the Son in the wisdom of God. Later, when the house is damaged by sin, Christ does not abandon His workmanship. The Creator becomes Redeemer, not to scrap the house, but to restore it.
 -- Quote --
 “Grace does not destroy nature. It heals and restores it.” Thomas Aquinas
 -- Metaphor --
 When a house passes inspection, the builder signs it off. That does not mean storms will never come, or that vandals will never damage it. But it does mean the design was sound and the workmanship true. “Very good” is God’s sign-off on the house He built through His Son.
 Application
 This guards you from two equal errors. Do not worship the house, and do not despise the house. Your body matters. Ordinary life matters. Work matters. Food, sleep, craft, learning, beauty, these are not beneath God. They are part of a world Christ made and intends to redeem.
-
And when the work is complete, the builder walks through and signs it off. Very good. Not because the house is divine, but because the workmanship is wise. This is Christ’s good world, and the damage of sin does not cancel the goodness of His design. The Builder will not abandon what He has made.

6: The Builder Rests, the House Stands, and Christ Sustains It
Genesis 2:1–3
 -- Exegesis --
 “Thus the heavens and the earth were finished.” God’s rest is not fatigue. It is the rest of completion and reign. He blesses the seventh day and makes it holy, setting a pattern of rest that is rooted in His own finished work. 
 Colossians 1:17 as the Christological anchor: “in him all things hold together.” The rest of Genesis 2 does not imply God steps away. It implies the structure is complete and stable, and it remains stable because Christ sustains it.
 -- Quote --
 “God’s rest is the celebration of a finished work.” - Meredith Kline
 -- Metaphor --
 When the builder steps back, it is not abandonment. It is the moment the house stands on its own integrity. But in the case of creation, the integrity itself is upheld by Christ. The house stands because the Son holds it together, every beam, every joint, every moment.
 Application
 This teaches believers how to rest without guilt and without fear. You are not the one keeping the world upright. You are not the one keeping your life from falling apart. Christ sustains all things, and that frees you to practise trust, to lay down anxious self-salvation, and to rest in the sovereignty of the Builder.
-
Now the builder rests, not because he is tired, but because the structure stands firm. The house is finished, and the rule is established. Yet even now it does not stand on its own. It holds together because Christ holds it together. So we can lay down our anxiety, because the weight of the world is not on our shoulders. It is in His hands.

Conclusion: The Builder Enters His Own House
-- Exegesis --
 Genesis begins with a good house. The rest of Scripture will show that the house becomes damaged by sin, and the inhabitants become rebels. But the gospel is that the Builder does not abandon His project. The Son through whom all things were made enters the world He made, takes on flesh, and comes not merely to forgive individuals, but to begin the renewal of creation itself. The cross is not Plan B. It is the heart of God’s purpose to redeem what He made. The resurrection is the firstfruits of the coming restoration. The new creation is not God throwing the house away, but God making all things new.
 -- Quote --
 “The Son of God became man to make men sons of God.” - Athanasius
 -- Metaphor --
 The builder does not shout instructions from afar. In Christ, the builder walks onto the site. He takes the weight. He bears the cost. He rebuilds from the inside out. The One who laid the foundations of the world lays Himself down for sinners, so that the house can be restored and the family brought home.
 Application
 So the question is not merely, do you admire the house. The question is, do you belong to the Builder. If Christ is Creator and Sustainer, then He has rightful claim over you. If Christ is Redeemer, then He offers mercy to you. Come to Him, trust Him, and live in His world as His servant, His worshipper, His child.

And he who was seated on the throne said, “Behold, I am making all things new.” Also he said, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.” - Rev 21:5
