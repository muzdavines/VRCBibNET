There are truths in Scripture that I have been avoiding and disobeying for most of my Christian life. I want to spend the coming weeks and months exploring those truths and asking tough questions about them.

It really revolves around one main question, and the question is, do I believe the Bible? Do I really and truly believe what it says.

Do I believe it, do I really believe it, because if I believe it, if this Book is true, then that has major implications for my life. And it’s really the question I want to put before you, then as a result. An all-important question, do we believe this Book? When this Book says some of the things it does, do we really believe it? And Luke 14 gives us a picture, I think if we believe this Book then it has major implications for our lives and major implications for the church.

We will be looking in coming weeks at many of the difficult things that Jesus said. I will mention some of them in passing today but we will be diving much deeper as we move on in this study. Today is an overview, and introduction to what we will be studying.

A summary verse is found in Luke chapter 14. Luke 14:33, this is Jesus speaking. Listen to what He says. “In the same way, any of you who does not give up everything he has cannot be my disciple.” That’s radical, Jesus says everything. And lest we think that He just means our possessions, go back up to Verse 26. Jesus says there, “If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother, his wife and children, his brothers and sisters—yes, even his own life— he cannot be my disciple.” That’s everything. And He says, you can’t call yourself a follower of mine if you don’t give up all these things. That is strikingly different than what we have all been taught about what it means to follow Jesus. What do we do with statements like this?

Too often we either ignore them completely or interpret them in such a way that they are not so offensive, not so difficult to accept. But doing that raises an important question: Is Jesus wrong about what it means to follow Him? Do we know more about being Christians than He does? Obviously the answer to both questions is a resounding NO!. But that means we must accept what He says.

This is a picture of demands of the gospel: Jesus says to give up everything you have if you even want to consider being His disciple. That’s what this whole passage is about. And so this question, do I really believe this Book has really kind of come in three main areas, and I want to ask you the questions that God has been asking me and convicting me about.

First question, do we believe what this Book says about the church? Turn back just a few chapters to the left, Luke 9. This is an amazing passage of Scripture, and we’re just going to hit on it real quickly, but do we believe what this Book says about what it means to follow Christ? Listen to this, there are large crowds at this point that are following Jesus and this is what happens. Luke 9:57, listen to what it says. “As they were walking along the road, a man said to him,” Him being Jesus, man said to Jesus, “‘I will follow you wherever you go.’ Jesus replied, ‘Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head’”

“He said to another man, ‘Follow me.’ But the man replied, ‘Lord, first let me go and bury my father.’ Jesus said to him, ‘Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.’ Still another said, ‘I will follow you, Lord; but first let me go back and say good-by to my family.’ Jesus replied, ‘No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God’” (Luke 9:59—62).

Is that not amazing? Jesus seems to be talking these three guys out of following Him.

This goes against our thinking. We think our whole picture today in the Church is to do whatever it takes to get them in, whatever it takes, get them in. Jesus is saying let the dead bury their own dead, don’t even go back and say goodbye to your family. These are the kind of things I wonder, when the disciples heard, if their jaws were just on the ground. Whenever the crowds would get big He’d say things like “eat my flesh” and “drink my blood,” and all of a sudden the crowds would leave and the disciples are like, “What are you doing? Jesus, we’re never going to get on the list of fastest growing movements if you don’t stop telling the crowds to eat you, this doesn’t work.”

But this is what He would do. What is He doing? Jesus is telling us what it means to follow Him. I want to ask three questions that I think we all need to meditate on when it comes to being a follower of Christ. If you call yourself a follower of Christ, this is what He says that means. Question number one, will we choose comfort or a cross? Comfort or a cross? First guy, “I’ll follow you wherever you go.” He’s eager. Jesus says, “Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head” (Luke 9:58).

In Matthew’s account of this scene in Matthew 8, he tells us that this man is a scribe, a religious leader. In that culture religious officials would attach themselves to religious teachers in order to promote or enhance their position and their status and their career. And so you’d follow another teacher to help promote you to the next level, to climb the ladder so to speak. And so here you’ve got a guy who wants to follow Jesus as a means to an end. We’re not Jewish culture trying to attach ourselves to Jesus to become greater teachers or climb the ladder, but this is too often the gospel we’re selling today. Jesus as a means to an end, “Come to Jesus so you can get forgiveness, and come to Jesus so you can get your best  life, and come to Jesus so you can get heaven.” And none of those things are true. You come to Jesus to get Jesus. You don’t come to Jesus to get stuff.

We come to Jesus so we can get a comfortable place to worship, and we come to Jesus so we can get activities for our kids to do, and we come to Jesus so we can get a good life in our comfortable western culture. No, you come to Jesus and you get Him, He’s the end. It’s not a means to anywhere. He is everything. We don’t want comfortable places to worship, we don’t want activities for kids, we don’t want to promote ourselves, we want Christ. And this guy…Here’s Jesus to say, “I don’t have a roof over my head, you come to me, I’m all you’ve got.” Do we want that kind of Jesus? Do we want comfort or do we want a cross, that’s where Jesus is going.

Second question, will we choose maintenance or mission? Maintenance or mission? Second guy, Jesus initiates the conversation with, “‘Follow me.’ But the man replied, ‘Lord, first let me go and bury my father.’ Jesus said to him, ‘Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God’”. Some people believe that his dad was about to die and he just wanted to go back, spend those last couple of days with his dad and then give his father a proper burial. Which is obviously something he would want to do, but even deeper than that was one of the highest of religious obligations, that a son honor his father. This is just a no-brainer, a son does this for his dad. Others believe his dad had just died. All he wanted to do was go back and bury his father then he’d come.

I cannot imagine hearing the words from Jesus, “Let somebody else bury your dad, go and proclaim the kingdom of God.” That just seems cold, doesn’t it? Let’s be honest; that’s harsh. This is the Jesus we’re worshiping and He would say that. What is He saying, what is He doing here? He’s saying that there is a responsibility and there is an obligation that supersedes every other responsibility and every other obligation in this world, even the thing you would most want to do or most need to do, you go and proclaim the kingdom of God, it’s far more important.

“Jesus don’t you care about us? Talking about mission all the time.” Jesus says don’t even bury your dad, go to mission. And we will always face these two options, maintenance or mission, business as usual, status quo, or radical abandonment to proclaiming the kingdom of God. Will we choose maintenance or mission?

Third, will we choose indecisive minds or undivided hearts, indecisive minds or undivided hearts? Lord, let me just go back and say goodbye to my family, and He says no one who puts his hand to the plow looks back, you can’t even look back. Don’t even go say goodbye to mom. You see the indecision here. It’s the sinful indecision that often grips us. Because when Jesus tells us to obey, at least in my own personal experience I find myself asking questions, “Well, is it safe? Well, is it wise? Really? Is it the time? What will this person think or that person think? How will this look?” The reality is if Jesus has said it, then a follower of Christ does it, period. His way is always the best way.

I’m not saying we don’t want to be wise, but wisdom is found in obedience to Jesus not in the world. And indecision hampers us from obedience to Christ as opposed to an undivided heart. And what scares me is the implication of Luke 9:57—62 is that these guys don’t follow Jesus. He succeeds in turning them away. What scares me is the thought of what I would do if I was one of those three guys, because I look at what we have done with what it means to follow Christ today, and I wonder if Jesus would move on and we’d still be standing there and this haunts me.

What does it mean to be a follower of this Jesus? I mean really, what does it mean to be a Christian? What does Jesus expect of us, empower us to do? What is expected of a Christian in the US or UK? Not a lot really, not a lot. That bar’s pretty low. What’s expected of a follower of Christ in Luke 9? Everything. Luke 14, everything. There is an urgency here that we so often ignore.

Second, do we believe what this Book says about the lost? People who do not know Jesus, people who do not trust in Jesus for salvation, do we believe what this Book says about them?

Do we believe 2 Thessalonians 1:7?

This will happen when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angels. He will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the majesty of his power.

Everlasting destruction.

Revelation 20:15, “If anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.” Earlier in the  same chapter John talks about how the smoke of their torment rises up forever and ever and ever. It raises the question: do we believe that? Do we believe that there is coming a day when those who do not trust in Jesus will be punished with everlasting, unending, destruction; door closed from the majesty of God forever? Instead, a lake of fire where the smoke of their torment burns forever and ever and ever without end. Do we believe that?

Because if we believe that then that has radical implications for the way we live our lives and the way a church operates. 8 billion people in the world today, the most liberal estimates would say about 30%, or 2.3 billion people of those are Christian. And that’s people who claim to be Christian, socially, politically, not necessarily all true followers of Christ. But let’s just assume for a second even if all one third of the people in the world today who claim to be Christian, let’s assume all of them are actually followers of Christ, have actually walked down this road and said, yes, I’ll abandon everything in Luke 9 and Luke 14.

Even if all one third of them are Christian, that still leaves over 5.7 billion people, over 5.7 billion people today on a road that leads to eternal hell; 5.7 billion people who today are standing under the judgment of God and are on a road that leads to an eternal hell. If that is true, if that’s true, if we believe that then we can’t play games in the church, and we can’t play games with following Christ

To be honest, we can’t even think about what is best for our families because we need to think about what’s best for the glory of Christ among people who are going to everlasting destruction where the smoke of their torment will burn forever and ever. If that’s true it radically changes the way we live. If that’s not true, then we spend our resources on ourselves and we indulge ourselves in stuff around us. If this is true, you can’t do that, it’s impossible, not if that’s true, not if we believe that’s true and you abandon everything to make the gospel known among the lost. So do we believe, do I believe, what this Book says about the lost?

And that leads to the third question, do we believe what this Book says about the church, do we believe what this Book says about the lost, and third, do we believe what this Book says about the poor? And here are the facts. Today, over 700 million people live and die in desperate poverty, live on less than a dollar a day. Other estimates say that about 1/3 of the world’s population lives on $2 a day. That would be about 2.7 billion people. The reality is most of our dogs and cats are living on more than $2.00 a day. And close to three billion people don’t have that much.

Let me bring it down to just today. 25,000 children today will breathe their last breath due to either starvation or a preventable disease. 25,000 children will wake up tomorrow but will not be alive when we go to bed tomorrow tonight  because they had no food, or no medical care for a disease that’s preventable. 25,000 of them. We don’t seem to care about those children. I wonder whether God does.

But here’s the deal, we don’t have to think about that. This is not before us.

We’re not even inconvenienced by that kind of extreme poverty because those stricken by it are not only poor, they are invisible. And we don’t have to see them; we don’t have to hear from them, we don’t have to have anything to do with them. Literally millions of them are quietly dying in relative obscurity and we can comfortably ignore them in our affluence, pretending like they don’t even exist. That sounds cold, but it is life here, isn’t it? Are we concerned when we drive through our communities about not having food or water, shelter? No, we’re going to the store to get our kids, ourselves more stuff. We don’t have to think about these, these are not realities that are before us. We can pretend like it’s not even there.

Meanwhile, they do exist. The reality is they do exist and here’s what frightens me. From cover to cover in Scripture God measures the integrity of our faith by our concern for the poor. That’s all over Scripture, all over the place. God measures the integrity of our faith by our concern for the poor. He says to His people, Isaiah, clear picture, 56—58, and this whole picture of true fasting. God says, “You’re fasting, you’re doing all your religious exercises, it means nothing if you ignore the poor. Nothing, it doesn’t mean anything. You claim to know me, you turn a deaf ear to the poor, you don’t know me.” That’s what He says to His people all the time. He measures the integrity of our faith by our concern for the poor. No concern for the poor, no integrity of faith. They go together.

To take it a step deeper, though, and on a most serious note, not more serious note, on the most serious note, I think, that we could see in scripture, Jesus tells those with abundance that if they do not feed the hungry and clothe the naked, they go to hell. Those with abundance, if you do not feed the hungry and clothe the naked you go to hell. This is what Jesus teaches, the Jesus we’re worshiping, He teaches this. And we’re going to dive into these passages in the coming weeks, but let me just give you an overview here.

Old Testament, leading up to when Jesus says that, listen to Proverbs 14:31, “Those who oppress the poor insult their maker.” You insult God. Church, people of God, you insult your God if you turn a deaf ear to the poor. Proverbs 21:13, listen to this, “If a man shuts his ears to the cry of the poor, he too will cry out and not be answered.”

What He says there, if a man shuts his ears to the cry of the poor; he too will cry and not be answered. You shut your ears to the cry of the poor—you pray—you got nothing. He doesn’t even hear you. You gather together every Sunday, not even heard Proverbs 21 says, if you’re shutting your ears to the cries of the poor, talking to yourselves. These are strong words. Proverbs 28:27, “He who gives to the poor will lack nothing,” great phrase, “…but he who closes his eyes to them receives many curses.” Cursed of God. Cursed by God if you close your eyes to the poor.

Luke 6, Jesus says this, Luke 6, these are Jesus’ words, Luke 6:20—25. It’s the beginning and the end of that passage. Jesus said, “Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you shall be satisfied” (Luke 6:20—21). “Woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation. Woe to you who are full now, for you shall be hungry” (Luke 6:24—25). James 5:1 takes it even deeper than a woe, listen to this, “Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you.” Can I remind you of something? We are rich, all of us, without exception. If you have food and clean water, you have clothing, you have shelter you are in the 75th percentile for wealth in comparison to world population. If you have access to medical care when you need it and even basic medicines, you’re in the 85th percentile. If you have access to reliable transportation, even public transportation, you are in the 90th percentile. And if you compare our wealth to all humans that have ever lived, you are in the 99th percentile. Basically, every one of us is in the top 1% of the wealthiest people who have ever lived.

So we’re all rich and the Bible says, “Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you.” Is this stern? It’s even sterner. Matthew 19:21—23, Jesus answered, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me. When the young man heard this, he went away sad, because he had great wealth. Then Jesus said to his disciples, ‘I tell you the truth, it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.” Now, did you catch that? We’re all rich and Jesus says it’s hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Put it together.

Jesus says it’s hard to go to heaven from the United States. It is hard to get to heaven from the United Kingdom. It’s hard for people here, including myself; it’s hard for us to go to heaven, very, very hard. Matthew 25:41 is where He says, and this is the passage, “Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me” (Matt. 25:40). Jesus says to those who do not feed the hungry and clothe the naked, He says these words, “Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels” (Matt. 25:41). You don’t feed the hungry or clothe the naked, then Jesus says to you, “Depart into eternal fire.” So maybe this is not just about other people who were concerned about fire, maybe there’s a concern that needs to be had among us about eternal fire.

I don’t believe I’m overstating this, not based on the words of Jesus. Now, follow me here. We’re going to dive into this passage, but just suffice to say at this point, this is not a passage that undercutting the rest of Scripture, and saying anything different than that, salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone, period. We know that from Scripture, no question. But if the love of Christ is not in someone then there’s reason to question whether or not Christ is in someone. If the truth of Christ is not in someone, if they’re speaking lies about Jesus then there’s reason to question whether or not Christ is in them.

If someone is walking in disobedient, persistent sin and does not turn from that sin, if you are living in willful disobedient sin against God and you were to say but I’m a Christian, I would look at you and I would say, based, I believe on the authority of Scripture in 1 John, amongst other places, I would say, “I do not know whether or not you are saved and it’s certainly not my place to determine that. At the same time, I would encourage you to ask very seriously whether or not Christ is really in you, if you are living in deliberate disobedience to Him. If there is deliberate disobedience in your life that is persistent, there is reason to question whether or not Christ is in you.” So bring that into this picture.

If this is what Jesus’ word says and we live with so much stuff, then there’s reason to question whether or not Jesus is really in us. This is huge. It’s a blind spot really. As I’ve been thinking and praying I’ve seen that this is a blind spot, and here’s what I mean by that. You know, 200 years ago there were seeming men of God who were preaching the gospel, and they had slaves. And we sit here like how could you have slaves if you’re preaching this gospel? It makes no sense. You say, of course, they shouldn’t have had slaves, not if they believe this gospel, not if they preach it. I wonder if 200 years from now, if Jesus has not come back, if they will look back at us and they will say how could they follow Jesus and have so much stuff? How could they know this gospel and live in such nice houses and drive such nice cars and have such nice clothes and things?

This is the blind spot that Christ has been opening my eyes and my heart to, and it’s come to this conclusion that I want to put before you in my life and I believe in the life of this church. It is time to get serious. You say, “What do you mean by that?” I don’t know what all of this means for my life and my family, so I certainly wouldn’t go as far as to say I know what this looks like in your life or your family, or even what this looks like for us as a faith family. But I do know that we need to ask the tough questions and spend serious time wrestling with what Jesus says it means to be Christian.

What I want to do is I want to invite us to go on a journey over the coming weeks, where we listen to the words from Jesus, the Jesus we claim to follow, but words that we obviously have ignored and I want us to listen to them. And I want us to consider together in our lives and our families what these words look like in action in our lives. I don’t think we could even begin to think through what this looks like for us as a faith family, until we’ve gone through this picture and where we’re saying, okay, what does it mean to follow this Christ, what does it mean to live radically for the lost, what does it mean to live radically for the poor.

If what this Book says is true…

And I know that there are probably people who will say, “I’m out. I don’t want to go on that kind of journey, I don’t have to go on that kind of journey. I can live my Christian life without that kind of journey.” That is an option. I would plead with you; I plead with you not to go there. But some of you may, and I want to be very careful here, because obviously what we’ve seen is that Jesus is, at some level, okay with that. And He’d say these things and the crowds would leave. He was left with 12 people

And I want to be really careful here because the last thing I want to do in saying that some may leave is to sound cold or insensitive, or some people might say unwise. I want to lead this group in this way, please hear this, not because I hate this church but because I love this church. And what frightens me is we don’t have to go this route. There are plenty of other routes before us to go; in fact, other routes that would let us draw more people. But in the process of doing that we would waste our lives and waste the church and we’d be successful here, but in the world to come for billions and billions of years we will realized how foolish we were.

And so, I want to invite you to go with me. None of us likes to think about changes in our lives, changes in our families, changes in the church. None of us, including myself. And if we turn a deaf ear to 25,000 kids today who are dying of starvation or preventable disease, then we don’t need to make any changes. That’s fine, we can do this. But if we’re going to live for the sake of 5.7 billion lost people, including thousands in our own neighborhoods and thousands and thousands and thousands of kids who are dying every day because they don’t have food on their table, then that means radical change in our lives, in our families and in the church. Again, I don’t know what all that looks like.

Please understand why I want to take this journey. Jesus is not looking to destroy our lives. He is not sitting in heaven saying “What can I do to rob them of happiness today, to make their wretched little lives even more miserable.” No, quite the contrary. He is inviting us into the best of all possible lives. He is inviting us to live our lives in complete submission to Him, to pay the price as did the man who found a treasure hidden in a field and IN HIS JOY went and sold all that he had and bought that field. He is inviting us to fully experience His presence in this life and to receive rewards beyond our capacity to even imagine in the next.

As hard as His teachings may seem, they are the only way to fulfilment in Him, the only way to truly experience what it means to follow Him.
