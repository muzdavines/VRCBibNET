Sermon 2: The Dawn Revealed – The Child in the Manger
Micah 5:2; Luke 2:1–20 
Intro: From Horizon to Manger
Advent teaches the church how to wait.
Before it teaches us how to celebrate, it teaches us how to long. That is why, for centuries, the church has sung, “O come, O come, Emmanuel,” not as a song of arrival, but as a prayer spoken from exile. It is the cry of a people who know the night is real, who feel the weight of waiting, and who ask God to come near because they cannot bring redemption about themselves.
That is the posture Scripture gives us as we come to the story of Christ’s birth.
Last week, we stood with Isaiah while the night was still deep. We heard him speak honestly about anguish and humiliation, about a people who had been brought low and treated as expendable. And yet into that real darkness, God spoke promise. Light would come. Joy would increase. Oppression would be broken. Peace would reign. And Isaiah was clear that this hope would not arrive first as a system, or a strategy, or a reform programme, but as a child. A son given. A King whose reign would grow like the rising day, guaranteed not by human effort, but by the zeal of the Lord of hosts.
This week, we move from promise to fulfilment. From horizon to household. From prophecy spoken centuries before to a child laid quietly in a manger. The dawn Isaiah announced does not break with noise or spectacle. It arrives humbly, faithfully, and decisively.
So we listen again to Scripture, watching carefully how God brings light into the world.
1 Now muster your troops, O daughter[b] of troops;
    siege is laid against us;
with a rod they strike the judge of Israel
    on the cheek.
2  But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah,
    who are too little to be among the clans of Judah,
from you shall come forth for me
    one who is to be ruler in Israel,
whose coming forth is from of old,
    from ancient days.
3 Therefore he shall give them up until the time
    when she who is in labor has given birth;
then the rest of his brothers shall return
    to the people of Israel.
4 And he shall stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the Lord,
    in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God.
And they shall dwell secure, for now he shall be great
    to the ends of the earth.
5 And he shall be their peace.
When the Assyrian comes into our land
    and treads in our palaces,
then we will raise against him seven shepherds
    and eight princes of men;

[s] MICAH 5:2: The dawn has an address
“But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days.”
-Exegesis-
Micah 5 unfolds the reign of the coming king in full, but it begins by fixing our eyes on one decisive truth: before we know what his kingdom will look like, God tells us where the king will come from.
Bethlehem is the town. Ephrathah is the older family and regional name attached to it. Micah uses both so there can be no doubt. The ruler God promises will come from David’s Bethlehem. (Zebulun) - 1 Samuel 17:12: David is “the son of an Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah”
Micah names a place with deliberate shock value.
Bethlehem is “too little.” That phrase is not sentimental. It is a statement about status. Bethlehem is not the sort of place that produces rulers. It is small, easy to overlook, easy to dismiss. In the world’s logic, it is not strategic. Not impressive. Not significant.
But God chooses it. And Micah is careful to tell us why. This ruler comes forth “for me,” meaning the ruler is commissioned by God and exists for God’s purposes, not merely for national pride or political stability. This is the Lord’s King.
And then Micah says something that forces theological depth. This ruler’s “coming forth is from of old, from ancient days.” Bethlehem speaks of time and place. Yet the ruler’s origin reaches beyond time and place. Micah holds together what we later confess plainly. The Messiah truly enters history, yet He is not trapped within history. He is born, yet His origin is eternal.
This is not merely a prediction. It is a declaration that the dawn is appointed. The light will not arise from human initiative. God has already marked the spot.
-Metaphor-
The dawn does not rise where the city lights are brightest. It rises where God appoints. The sun is not impressed by prominence.
-
B. B. Warfield - “The incarnation is not a miracle in the life of Christ, it is the miracle.” Bethlehem is the appointed place where the miracle will touch earth.
-Application-
Micah dismantles our instincts about significance. God does not begin salvation in the strong places, but in the small places. He delights to bring glory into what the world calls “too little.” That means no faithful obedience is wasted. No obscure service is meaningless. No small church is irrelevant. The question is not whether we are impressive enough to host God’s work, but whether we will receive what He gives.
-Bridge to Luke-
Micah tells us where. But he does not tell us how the promised King will arrive there. How does God bring a young couple from Nazareth to Bethlehem at the precise moment? How does the eternal ruler enter time? For that, we turn to Luke, and we watch the dawn break into history.
1 In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered. 2 This was the first registration when[a] Quirinius was governor of Syria. 3 And all went to be registered, each to his own town. 4 And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, 5 to be registered with Mary, his betrothed,[b] who was with child. 6 And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth. 7 And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.
8 And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. 9 And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with great fear. 10 And the angel said to them, “Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. 11 For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. 12 And this will be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in swaddling cloths and lying in a manger.” 13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,
14 “Glory to God in the highest,
    and on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased!”[d]
15 When the angels went away from them into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.” 16 And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger. 17 And when they saw it, they made known the saying that had been told them concerning this child. 18 And all who heard it wondered at what the shepherds told them. 19 But Mary treasured up all these things, pondering them in her heart. 20 And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.

[s]LUKE 2:1–3: In the days of Caesar, God is still King
“In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered.”
-Exegesis-
Luke begins with Caesar on purpose. He wants you to feel the weight of empire. Caesar issues a decree, and people move. Rome counts, taxes, controls. It appears as though history belongs to the powerful.
Yet Luke’s theology is quietly stronger than Rome’s propaganda. Caesar thinks he is arranging his empire. In reality, he is serving God’s promise. The decree is the human mechanism by which the divine plan is advanced. God’s sovereignty is not fragile. It does not depend on sympathetic rulers. It is so comprehensive that even unwitting opposition becomes a servant of fulfilment.
Luke is also doing something pastorally crucial. He is telling you the incarnation happened “in those days,” not “once upon a time.” It is not fable. It is the invasion of God into public history.
-Metaphor-
The dawn rises while emperors issue decrees. The sun does not ask permission from politics.
-
Abraham Kuyper -  “There is not a square inch in the whole domain of our human existence over which Christ, who is Sovereign over all, does not cry, Mine.” Caesar’s decree is included in that domain.
-Application-
This steadies believers in anxious times. The church does not need to fear the machinery of the world. God’s plan is not threatened by those who do not acknowledge Him. Advent calls us to live with calm confidence, not because human leaders are reliable, but because God is.

[s]LUKE 2:4–5: God fulfils prophecy through ordinary obedience
“And Joseph also went up… to Bethlehem… because he was of the house and lineage of David.”
-Exegesis-
Luke now narrows the lens from empire to a carpenter. Joseph’s lineage matters because the Davidic promise matters. Isaiah spoke of a throne. Micah spoke of a ruler. Luke shows the line by which God keeps His word.
Joseph’s journey is not heroic. It is necessary. It is inconvenient. It is ordinary. And that is precisely how God so often works. The fulfilment of prophecy rides on everyday obedience. The King enters Bethlehem not by conquest but by a compelled journey, the sort of thing that feels like interruption, yet is the very pathway of providence.
Luke also hints at the hidden cost. Mary is with child. Travel is hard. The timing is tight. Salvation does not enter history in comfort.
-Metaphor-
The dawn advances mile by mile. It crosses hills and valleys without haste, without delay.
-
J. C. Ryle wrote, “Nothing is too great, too small, or too trifling for the eye of God.” This journey looks small, but it is carrying the weight of redemption.
-Application-
God’s purposes often move through the parts of life we call mundane. That should reshape how we see faithfulness. The obedience that feels unseen may be the very means by which God blesses others. Advent teaches patience. It teaches trust. It teaches that God is at work in the journey as well as the destination.

[s]LUKE 2:6–7: The King arrives in humility
“And while they were there, the time came… and she gave birth to her firstborn son… and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.”
-Exegesis-
Luke’s language is restrained, and that restraint is deliberate. The most astonishing event in history is narrated plainly. God’s Son is born, and Luke does not decorate it. That is the point. Heaven’s miracle does not arrive with earthly spectacle.
The phrase “firstborn” signals real humanity and real family life. The swaddling cloths signal ordinary care. The manger signals poverty and marginalisation. “No place for them” is not merely a travel inconvenience. It is a theological sign. The world has no room for its King. The light comes into darkness, and the darkness does not welcome it.
Yet this is not defeat. This is the method of salvation. The humility of the manger is already the posture of the cross. The incarnation is God’s descent. The King comes low to raise the low.
-Metaphor-
The sun rises quietly. No trumpet announces it. Yet the whole world is changed by it.

Athanasius wrote, “He took a body like ours, because all our bodies were liable to the corruption of death.” The manger is the beginning of the rescue, not a decorative detail.
-Application-
This confronts our instincts. We often look for God in what is impressive, successful, polished. Advent trains us to recognise God’s work in humility. If the King comes in weakness, then pride will always miss Him. But the humble will see the light.
This also comforts the lowly. If Christ comes to a manger, then there is no place He will not enter to save. No shame, no poverty, no obscurity can keep Him out.

[s]LUKE 2:8–12: God announces the dawn to shepherds
“And in the same region there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch… by night.”
-Exegesis-
Luke’s scene changes, but the darkness remains. Shepherds are in the field “by night.” That phrase is not just time of day, it is atmosphere. We are still in darkness when the announcement comes.
Shepherds were not socially honoured. They were peripheral, regarded with suspicion, and they lived on the edge of respectable society. Yet God chooses them. The first human witnesses of Messiah’s arrival are not priests in the temple courts or scholars in Jerusalem, but working men in the night.
The angel’s message is loaded. “Good news of great joy… for all the people.” This is not tribal news. It is salvation news. And then the titles: “a Saviour… Christ… the Lord.” Saviour addresses our need. Christ addresses God’s promise. Lord addresses His authority. Isaiah’s child, Micah’s ruler, is now named.
The sign is equally striking. Not “you will find Him in a palace,” but “you will find a baby wrapped… lying in a manger.” The humility is not incidental. It is proof.
Metaphor
The first rays of dawn fall on open fields, not guarded halls. Light chooses the margins.
J. I. Packer - “God became small enough to lie in a manger.” That is not sentiment, it is theological wonder.
-Application-
If God reveals His glory to shepherds first, then grace is not reserved for the polished. It is offered to the needy. Advent invites us to come honestly, not performing, not pretending, but receiving.
And there is also a call to humility in witness. Shepherds become heralds. The Gospel makes proclaimers out of the overlooked.

[s]LUKE 2:13–14: Heaven interprets the dawn
“And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God…”
-Exegesis-
Heaven now provides the interpretation. The birth of Christ is not merely the arrival of a child. It is the revelation of God’s glory and the beginning of peace.
“Glory to God in the highest.” The ultimate goal of redemption is doxology, the display of God’s worth. Salvation is not man-centred. It is God-centred.
“And on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased.” Peace is not general tranquillity. It is covenant peace, reconciliation, the restoration of right relationship with God. This is the peace Isaiah promised, grounded in the reign of the Prince of Peace.
Notice the order. Glory first, then peace. Peace flows down from God’s glory, not up from human effort. The world cannot manufacture this peace. It must be given.
-Metaphor-
The dawn is now undeniable. The sky fills. The horizon is flooded. What began quietly becomes unmistakable.
Augustine said, “Our hearts are restless until they rest in you.” Peace is not simply calm, it is rest in God.
-Application-
This teaches us what peace truly is. Not the absence of conflict, but reconciliation with God. Advent calls us away from shallow peace-making and toward the deep peace Christ purchases. If your conscience is unsettled, if your heart is restless, the answer is not distraction. It is Christ.

[s]LUKE 2:15–20: Walking in the light
“Let us go over to Bethlehem… and they went with haste…”
-Exegesis-
The shepherds respond. They go. They see. They make known. Then they return.
That pattern matters. They do not remain in the field discussing. They move toward Christ. They verify the word. They become witnesses. And then they go back into ordinary life, but not unchanged. They return “glorifying and praising God.”
This is early discipleship. The Gospel produces movement toward Christ, proclamation about Christ, and worship because of Christ.
Luke also shows Mary’s response. She treasures and ponders. Shepherds proclaim. Mary meditates. The Gospel creates different kinds of faithful response, but all are centred on Christ.
-Metaphor-
The day has begun. People now live and work in its light. They return to normal places, but now everything is seen differently.
C. S. Lewis wrote, “I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen, not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else.” The shepherds go back, but now they see their world in a new light.
-Application-
Advent is not meant to terminate in admiration. It is meant to produce worship and witness.
Some will be more like Mary, treasuring and pondering, quietly shaped over time. Some will be more like the shepherds, speaking and proclaiming. But none can remain untouched. To see the dawn is to live differently.
And this also gives courage. You do not need a platform to speak of Christ. Shepherds had none. You do not need status. You need sight, you need Christ, and you need the simple faithfulness to tell what you have heard and seen.

Series Conclusion – People of the Dawn
Over these two weeks, Scripture has been teaching us how God brings light into the world.
Last week, we stood with Isaiah while the night was still deep. We heard him speak honestly about anguish and humiliation, about a people who had been brought low and treated as expendable. Zebulun and Naphtali were named, not as poetic symbols, but as real places where darkness had fallen first. And yet into that real, historical darkness, God spoke promise. Light would come. Joy would increase. Oppression would be broken. Peace would reign.
And Isaiah was clear that this hope would not arrive first as a system, or a strategy, or a reform programme. It would arrive as a child. A son given. A King whose reign would grow like the rising day, guaranteed not by human effort, but by the zeal of the Lord of hosts. The dawn would not be engineered. It would be given.
Then Luke took us closer still. In Luke chapter 1, we watched that promise narrow from horizon to household. The light Isaiah saw at a distance entered a room in Nazareth. Not to someone powerful, not to someone prepared, but to Mary, a young woman with no status and no control over what lay ahead. And when the angel spoke, Mary did not respond with certainty or strength, but with surrender. “Let it be to me according to your word.”
That moment matters. Because the promise began to move toward fulfilment not only by divine power, but through humble trust. God does not force the dawn upon His people. He invites them to receive it.
And now, this week, Luke has brought us all the way to Bethlehem. The address Micah named centuries earlier becomes the place where the promise arrives. Under an imperial decree, through an ordinary journey, the child is born. The King comes without spectacle, laid in a manger because there is no room. And the first announcement is not made to those at the centre of power, but to shepherds keeping watch in the dark.
The light Isaiah saw on the horizon has broken into the world quietly, humbly, unmistakably.
When we step back and look at the whole story together, a pattern emerges that cannot be ignored. The dawn always breaks at the edges. It comes to those who are waiting, weary, uncertain, and overlooked. It comes to people who know the night from the inside.
Which means this good news is not addressed to the strong, the sorted, or the spiritually impressive. It is addressed to the unfaithful. To the weak and unstable. To the barren and waiting. To the bitter and broken. To the guilty and hiding.
Not because God lowers His standards, but because salvation has never been about human adequacy. The light comes because the darkness is real. The child is born because we cannot save ourselves. Grace does not meet us once we are ready. It meets us because we are not.
That is why the shape of our response matters. We began by singing, “O come, O come, Emmanuel,” a prayer that rises from exile. A song that assumes the night is real, that God feels distant, and that we are waiting for redemption we cannot bring about ourselves. It is the cry of Isaiah’s world. It is the cry of Mary before the child is born. It is the cry of all who know what it is to wait in the dark.
And now, having watched the promise fulfilled, having seen the dawn break quietly in Bethlehem, the invitation changes. It does not become louder or more triumphant. It becomes more personal. Come. Come as you are. Come with empty hands. Come not because you have something to offer, but because Christ Himself is the offering.
Come.
Come, all you unfaithful.
 Come, weak and unstable.
 Come, know you are not alone.
Come, barren and waiting ones, weary of praying.
 Come, see what your God has done.
This is not sentiment. This is the gospel in song. The invitation rests entirely on divine action, not human qualification. We are called to come not because we are worthy, but because Christ is born for us.
So as we sing now, we are not performing faith. We are practising it. We are doing what Advent has taught us to do. We are stepping out of the night and into the light that has already come.
We are people of the dawn, not because we see clearly, but because the Light has come near.
And we live now in that growing light, waiting for the full day, trusting that the God who spoke light into darkness, who brought promise into flesh, and who laid His Son in a manger, will finish what He has begun.
So let us come and sing together.
Christ is born.
 Christ is born for you.
Amen.
