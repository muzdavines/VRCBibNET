Romans Series Finale
“The Final Beam of Light: Standing Firm in the Gospel”
Romans 16:17–27
Series: The Global Family of Faith
Slide 1 – The Final Beam of Light:
Standing Firm in the Gospel
Introduction – The Last Steps Down the Lighthouse Tower

We have spent many weeks climbing through the lighthouse of Romans.
 We entered in darkness as Paul showed us human sin.
 We climbed into the brighter rooms of grace, justification, and life in the Spirit.
 We stood in the lantern room of God’s sovereignty in chapters 9 to 11.
 We entered the workshop of discipleship and unity in chapters 12 to 15.
 Then last time, in Romans 16:1–16, we met the lighthouse crew, the ordinary saints who kept the flame burning in Rome.
Now Paul brings his letter to its close.
 This is not a soft ending but a strong and clear one.
 A final beam of light sweeping across the stormy sea, calling the church to stand firm, stay faithful, and shine the gospel.
(Scripture reading here)
 Romans 16:17–27

1. A Final Warning: The Saboteurs of the Lighthouse vv17-18
Slide 2 – A Final Warning
“I appeal to you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine you have been taught. Avoid them.
 For such persons do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites, and by smooth talk and flattery deceive the hearts of the naive.”
Paul is gentle with struggling believers, but he is fierce with false teachers.
 This is not about minor disagreements.
 This is not about differing preferences.
 This is not about personalities.
This is about people who deliberately undermine the gospel,
 fracture the unity of the church,
 and pull believers away from the truth.
Paul uses three clear marks of a false teacher:
1. They cause division.
Not godly discernment, but fracturing.
2. They create obstacles to sound doctrine.
They interfere with or add to the gospel.
3. They deceive with smooth talk.
False teachers rarely shout.
 They charm.
 They flatter.
 They talk their way into hearts that are not anchored in Scripture.
Paul says: avoid them, meaning cut off their influence.
Matthew Henry put it starkly:
 “Error is infectious. Those who love truth must flee from those who would corrupt it.”
This is lighthouse language:
A good keeper trims the wick.
A good keeper guards the flame.
A good keeper does not let anyone near the oil who would tamper with it.


And Paul makes their motive clear:
 “They do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites.”
False teachers build platforms, not churches.
 They seek followers, not disciples.
 They want admiration, not repentance.
This is why Paul breaks the warm tone of Romans 16 with this flashing signal of danger.

 Application
False teachers are not always obvious.
 Many are polite.
 Many sound spiritual.
 Many dress their teaching in the language of compassion or personal revelation.
Paul’s answer is simple:
 Watch out.
 Be anchored.
 Be discerning.
 Stay close to Scripture.
You do not guard the lighthouse flame by trusting everyone.
 You guard it by trusting the Word.
Avoiding false teachers is not unloving.
 It is protecting the weak.
 It is guarding unity.
 It is honouring Christ.
A church that refuses to guard the gospel will eventually lose it.


2. A Final Encouragement: Your Obedience Shines v19-20
Slide 3 – Protecting the Flame
Paul now turns from warning to affirmation.
 “Your obedience is known to all,” he says. Rome was known for empire and wealth. The church was known for obedience. That is a testimony worth having.
He calls them to be “wise in good and innocent in evil.”
 Wise in good means feeding your heart on what is holy.
 Innocent in evil means refusing to let sin instruct your imagination.
Then the astonishing promise:
 “The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.”
The crushing belongs to God. The feet belong to the saints.
R. C. Sproul wrote, “The believer’s strength lies not in himself but in the God who fights for him.”

Application
Obedience may seem quiet, but heaven sees it. It is a witness, a weapon, and participation in the victory of Christ. Every act of faithfulness, every moment you resist temptation, every choice for righteousness—these are steps taken in God’s triumph.
To be “wise in good” is to train your instincts.
 To be “innocent in evil” is to refuse spiritual poison.
And God promises: He will crush the enemy.
 You are not fighting alone.
 God fights for you, through you, and with you.

3. A Final Greeting: The Wider Lighthouse Network vv 21-24
Slide 4 – God of Peace, God of Victory
Paul now widens the lens. After dealing with danger and obedience, he introduces the team standing beside him in Corinth. It is as if he opens the lighthouse door and reveals the faithful workers around him who make this ministry possible.
Wider lighthouse crew
Here we meet Timothy, Paul’s closest partner. Tertius, the scribe who physically wrote Romans as Paul dictated. Gaius, the generous host whose home became the base of operations. Quartus, a faithful brother in the Lord. These individuals remind us that gospel work is always shared work. The kingdom advances through fellowship, cooperation, and mutual encouragement.
Now Paul honours them. He celebrates their service. He gives the church a glimpse of the fellowship behind the letter.
Application
These names are a testimony to the hidden servants of God.
 The prayer warriors.
 The encouragers.
 The givers.
 The hosts.
 The behind-the-scenes workers who keep the flame steady.
J. I. Packer said, “Christian fellowship is a foretaste of the family we will share for eternity.”
Your faithfulness, even when unseen, strengthens others.
 The kingdom is built by ordinary believers who simply remain faithful.

4. A Final Doxology: The Eternal Purpose of God
Slide 5 – Strengthened by the Gospel
Paul ends Romans with one of the greatest doxologies in Scripture. His tone rises. His vision expands. His heart lifts in worship. He reminds the church that God is able to strengthen them. Not by their willpower. Not by emotional energy. But by the gospel.
The gospel that saved them is the gospel that sustains them.
God’s plan was eternal. His wisdom is perfect. His glory is ultimate. From creation to redemption, from Israel to the nations, from the cross to the resurrection, from Corinth to Rome, God’s hand has guided everything according to His eternal purpose.
John Owen wrote, “The goal of all God’s works is that His Son might be glorified in the hearts of His people.”
Paul ends Romans exactly there: with glory.
Application
This doxology invites you to rest.
 You do not hold on to God by your strength; God holds on to you by His.
 His wisdom is older than time, deeper than your fears, and stronger than your weakness.
Let your life become a quiet hymn of praise.
 Let your choices, your relationships, and your character say,
 “To the only wise God be glory.”

Conclusion – Carry the Light
Slide 6 – Carry the Light
We have walked through sixteen chapters of Romans.
 We have seen guilt.
 We have seen grace.
 We have seen the cross.
 We have seen the Spirit.
 We have seen the sovereignty of God.
 We have seen the beauty of the global church.
 And we have seen the glory that crowns it all.
Romans has shaped us.  Anchored us. Strengthened us.
 It has placed the light of Christ into our hands.
Now Paul sends us back into the world, down the lighthouse steps, into the wind, into the mission field.
Carry the light.
 Guard the truth.
 Walk in obedience.
 Honour the family of faith.
 Trust the eternal wisdom of God.
Slide 7 – Final Blessing
Romans began with grace and ends with glory.
 May your life do the same.
To the only wise God be glory forevermore through Jesus Christ. Amen.
Slide 8 - Benediction
25 Now to him who is able to strengthen you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery that was kept secret for long ages 26 but has now been disclosed and through the prophetic writings has been made known to all nations, according to the command of the eternal God, to bring about the obedience of faith— 27 to the only wise God be glory forevermore through Jesus Christ! Amen.
