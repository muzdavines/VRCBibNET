-WHEN THE DAWN BREAKS
- Sermon 1: The Promised Dawn – The Child on the Horizon
- Isaiah 9:1–7; Luke 1:26–38
Over the next two weeks in Advent, we’re going to slow down and sit with one of Scripture’s most powerful images for salvation, the image of dawn.
Not the moment when the sun is already high and the day is clear, but that quieter moment when the night has not yet fully lifted, and yet something has changed. The horizon begins to glow. The darkness is still real, but it is no longer final.
I’ve called this short series “When the Dawn Breaks.”
 Because Advent is not the celebration of a finished story, but the announcement that God has acted, and therefore the future is secure.
This week, we will stand with the prophet Isaiah, looking toward the horizon. We will listen as God speaks promise into real historical darkness. Next week, we will move from promise to fulfilment, from prophecy to manger, from the first glimmer of light to the light made visible in the birth of Christ.
Isaiah speaks into a moment of national collapse. His words are not written in a vacuum. By the time he speaks, parts of Israel have already fallen. In the northern regions, towns have been emptied, people deported, and land treated as expendable. The Scriptures record this for us in the book of Kings. The darkness Isaiah names is not metaphor alone. It is lived history.
And it is precisely into that kind of darkness that God speaks hope.
Isaiah does not deny the night. He names anguish, humiliation, and deep darkness. But he also declares that God has not finished His work. He announces that light will come, that joy will increase, that oppression will be broken, and that peace will reign.
And remarkably, he tells us that all of this will arrive not first as a system or a structure, but as a child.
So today, we begin where Isaiah begins. Not with fulfilment, but with promise. Not with the manger, but with the horizon. We listen for the first announcement of dawn, trusting that the God who speaks light into darkness will keep His word.
So let’s turn now to Isaiah chapter 9, and hear what God says to His people while the night is still deep. :
1 But there will be no gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but in the latter time he has made glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations. 2 The people who walked in darkness
    have seen a great light;
those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness,
    on them has light shone.
3 You have multiplied the nation;
    you have increased its joy;
they rejoice before you
    as with joy at the harvest,
    as they are glad when they divide the spoil.
4 For the yoke of his burden,
    and the staff for his shoulder,
    the rod of his oppressor,
    you have broken as on the day of Midian.
5 For every boot of the tramping warrior in battle tumult
    and every garment rolled in blood
    will be burned as fuel for the fire.
6 For to us a child is born,
    to us a son is given;
and the government shall be upon[d] his shoulder,
    and his name shall be called[e]
Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
    Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
7 Of the increase of his government and of peace
    there will be no end,
on the throne of David and over his kingdom,
    to establish it and to uphold it
with justice and with righteousness
    from this time forth and forevermore.
The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.

ISAIAH 9:1–2: Into deep darkness, God speaks light.
“The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shone.”
-Exegesis-
Isaiah begins with honesty. He names anguish and contempt. Zebulun and Naphtali, the northern regions, had been humiliated first. Darkness here is not poetic exaggeration. It is lived experience. Political defeat, spiritual confusion, and the sense that God’s promises have stalled.
When Isaiah names Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, he is not being poetic. He is being precise. These were northern regions, exposed to invasion, hit first by Assyria, and treated as expendable. They became symbols of defeat and humiliation, places written off politically and spiritually. Isaiah begins there deliberately. Because God’s salvation does not start at the centre of power, but at the edges. The places first brought into contempt are the first promised light. And when Jesus later begins His ministry in Galilee, Matthew tells us this is no coincidence. The geography of shame becomes the geography of grace.
That moment is recorded in 2 Kings 15:29, where we’re told that Tiglath-pileser of Assyria captured Galilee and the land of Naphtali and carried the people away.
Yet Isaiah speaks with astonishing certainty. He uses the language of fulfilment for what has not yet occurred. “Have seen a great light.” This is prophetic certainty. God speaks of the future as settled because His word determines reality.
Notice also where the light comes from. It does not rise from the people. It shines upon them. Salvation is not human potential awakened. It is divine intervention.
-Metaphor-
This is the first glow on the horizon. The night has not vanished, but it has been sentenced. Darkness still surrounds, but it is no longer ultimate.
-Quote-
Karl Barth wrote, “The Gospel is not a truth among other truths. It is the truth which sets all other truths in their proper place.”
-Application-
Advent teaches us how to interpret our lives. Many believers read their circumstances as final, as though darkness has the last word. Isaiah teaches us to read our lives by God’s declaration, not by present visibility.
You may still be walking in darkness, but if God has spoken light, then hope is not naïve. It is obedience. Faith does not deny the night. Faith trusts that the night will not last forever because God has said so.

ISAIAH 9:3–5 The dawn brings joy, freedom, and peace.
“For the yoke of his burden, and the staff for his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, you have broken as on the day of Midian.”
-Exegesis-
Isaiah now describes what happens as the light spreads. Joy increases, not shallow happiness, but harvest joy. Joy that comes after long waiting and proves God’s faithfulness.
Oppression is shattered. The yoke, staff, and rod describe sustained domination. And Isaiah anchors this deliverance in Israel’s memory. “As on the day of Midian.” Gideon’s victory was deliberately engineered by God to exclude boasting. Salvation came through weakness so that glory would belong to God alone.
The burning of war garments signals more than victory. It signals the end of hostility. God’s salvation is not a temporary ceasefire. It is peace.
-Metaphor-
As dawn spreads, the cold lifts. Shapes emerge. Fear loosens its grip. The light does not negotiate with darkness. It advances.
-Quote-
J. I. Packer wrote, “The Christmas message is that there is hope for a ruined humanity… because at the Father’s will Jesus became poor.”
-Application-
Many Christians still live as though the yoke remains intact. Old guilt, old fears, old accusations linger as though Christ never broke their power. Isaiah reminds us that freedom is grounded in God’s action, not our effort.
If salvation is “as on the day of Midian,” then God will often deliver us in ways that humble us. Advent teaches us to look for God’s power in weakness and to receive joy as a gift, not an achievement.

 ISAIAH 9:6 -The Child is the Light of the dawn.
“For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder.”
Exegesis
Here Isaiah brings the dawn into sharp focus. Up to this point, he has spoken of light, joy, freedom, and peace. Now he tells us where all of it comes from.
“For to us a child is born.”
 This is true humanity. Birth implies weakness, dependence, vulnerability. God’s salvation enters the world not fully formed and triumphant, but as a real human child. This guards us from imagining a distant or merely symbolic redeemer. The Messiah is one of us.
“To us a son is given.”
 This goes beyond birth. The language of gift points to divine origin and initiative. This son is not merely born into existence. He is given from God. Isaiah holds together humanity and divinity without embarrassment or explanation. The church will later give this language doctrinal clarity, but Isaiah already gives us the reality.
“The government shall be upon his shoulder.”
 Authority does not gradually accumulate to this child. It rests upon Him. He bears rule and responsibility as part of His identity. This is kingship, but not the kind Israel expected. The burden of rule is carried by the one who comes in humility.
Isaiah then names Him, and these names are not poetic flourishes. They are theological declarations.
Wonderful Counsellor speaks of wisdom that is not merely insightful, but divine. He does not simply give good advice. He reveals the mind of God and directs His people in truth.
Mighty God is unambiguous. Isaiah applies to the child a title used elsewhere of Yahweh Himself. This is not hyperbole. The light of the dawn is God in the flesh.
Everlasting Father does not confuse the persons of the Trinity. Rather, it describes the nature of the Messiah’s reign. His rule is fatherly, protective, enduring, and faithful. Unlike earthly kings, His care does not expire.
Prince of Peace tells us the goal of His reign. He does not merely negotiate peace. He establishes it. He reconciles sinners to God and restores what sin has fractured.
Isaiah’s point is clear. The dawn is not an abstract hope. It is the personal arrival of God Himself, ruling in grace and power.
- Metaphor-
This is the moment the sun itself rises above the horizon.
Earlier, Isaiah spoke of light spreading across the land. Now we see the source. The dawn has a face. The warmth has a name. What was once only promise is now recognisable.
The child is not illuminated by the light. He is the light.
-Quote-
Athanasius wrote, “He became what we are, that He might make us what He is.”
 The incarnation is not God sending help from a distance, but God stepping into our darkness personally.
-Application-
This section confronts us with the question of who Jesus really is.
If Isaiah is right, then Jesus cannot be reduced to a moral teacher, a religious example, or a comforting symbol of hope. He is Mighty God. That leaves no room for neutrality. He is either worshipped or resisted.
But Isaiah also shows us that this divine King comes gently. He comes as a child. That means His authority is not harsh, and His power is not threatening. The government rests on His shoulder, not on ours.
For those who are weary of carrying burdens, this is good news. For those who are confused, He is Wonderful Counsellor. For those who feel exposed or insecure, His reign is fatherly and enduring. For those who carry guilt, anxiety, or inner conflict, He is the Prince of Peace.
Advent invites us not merely to admire the child, but to entrust ourselves to Him. To let the light that has risen define reality, reorder our loyalties, and command our worship.
The dawn has a name.
 And His name is Jesus.

The child in the story is the Lord of glory in flesh.

ISAIAH 9:7 -His kingdom grows like the rising day.
“Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end… The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.”
-Exegesis-
Isaiah now lifts our eyes beyond the first appearance of the dawn to its full outcome. The child of verse 6 does not merely arrive. He reigns. And His reign is not static.
“Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end.”
 This kingdom does not peak and decline like every human empire. It grows. It expands. It advances through history. Peace does not merely accompany it; peace increases with it.
Isaiah then anchors this reign in covenant history. “On the throne of David.” This is not a new plan. It is the fulfilment of God’s promise to David, a promise that seemed increasingly fragile as Israel’s kings failed and the nation fractured. Isaiah insists that God has not forgotten His word.
The nature of this kingdom is then defined. It is upheld with justice and righteousness. Power and morality are not separated. Authority and goodness are united. This is rule as it was always meant to be, not coercive dominance, but righteous order under God.
And then Isaiah gives the ultimate guarantee. Not human obedience. Not political stability. Not religious effort.
“The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.”
God’s zeal is His passionate, covenant-keeping commitment to accomplish His purposes. This kingdom is secure because God Himself is invested in it. The future of the Messiah’s reign does not depend on the strength of His people, but on the faithfulness of their God.
-Metaphor-
This is the dawn becoming full day.
The sun does not rise and then hesitate. It does not stop halfway because the night resists. Once it has risen, it fills the sky. Its light spreads steadily, inevitably, transforming everything it touches.
So it is with the kingdom of Christ. It does not flicker. It does not stall. It advances quietly, steadily, irresistibly, until the whole day is filled with light.
-Quote-
Charles Spurgeon said, “There is no attribute of God which gives the sinner greater hope than His faithfulness.”
 Isaiah grounds hope not in human progress, but in God’s unwavering commitment to His promise.
-Application-
This is where Advent steadies the church.
We often read the world with anxiety, as though darkness is winning and God is reacting. Isaiah teaches us to read history differently. The kingdom of Christ is not fragile. It is increasing. Peace is not retreating. It is expanding.
That does not mean the night has vanished. Dawn and daylight are not the same moment. Shadows still exist. Conflict still lingers. But the direction is set. The sun is up.
This frees us from panic and from despair. We labour, pray, witness, and endure not because we are anxious about the outcome, but because the outcome is secure. God’s zeal guarantees the future, even when the present feels unstable.
For weary believers, this is reassurance. You are not carrying the kingdom on your shoulders. The government rests on His. And He will not drop it.
-Bridge to Luke-
But Isaiah leaves us standing at the horizon.
He tells us what God will do, who will reign, and how secure the kingdom is. What he does not yet show us is how the dawn actually enters the world.
So the question remains.
 How does the eternal kingdom begin?
 How does the divine King step into human history?
 Where does this unstoppable reign touch ordinary life?
To answer that, we turn from prophecy to fulfilment.
 From vision to visitation.
 From promise spoken centuries before, to promise entering a room in Nazareth.
And for that, we listen now to Luke.

LUKE 1:26–37 -The promise becomes flesh. The dawn breaks in.
 “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.”
-Exegesis-
Luke anchors the incarnation in history. Gabriel is sent by God to Nazareth, to Mary. Grace comes to the overlooked.
Mary is favoured, not because of merit, but because of grace. The Spirit’s overshadowing echoes creation itself. The child will be holy. Fully God. Fully man.
“For nothing will be impossible with God” is not human ambition. It is divine certainty.
-Metaphor-
The dawn enters a room. Light from above breaks into ordinary life.
-Quote-
Augustine wrote, “God gives where He finds empty hands.”
Application
If God can unite deity and humanity, no sin is beyond forgiveness, no darkness beyond His light. Advent expands our theology and our hope.
7. LUKE 1:38 - We walk in the growing light of Christ.
“Behold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.”
Exegesis
Mary’s response is brief, but it is not shallow. It is one of the most theologically loaded sentences in the New Testament.
She identifies herself first: “I am the servant of the Lord.” This is not self-negation, but right ordering. Mary places herself within God’s purposes rather than attempting to manage them. She recognises that the God who speaks has the right to command, and that obedience is not a loss of dignity but the proper posture of faith.
Then she submits to God’s word: “Let it be to me according to your word.” This is not passive resignation. It is active trust. Mary does not yet see the outcome. She does not yet understand the cost. She knows enough to obey, but not sufficient to control.
This is crucial. Biblical faith is not agreement with abstract ideas. It is submission to God’s word when the future is still largely hidden. Mary entrusts her body, her reputation, her relationships, and her future to God's faithfulness.
Luke deliberately places this response at the moment where promise turns toward fulfilment. The incarnation proceeds not only by divine power, but through human obedience shaped by grace. God does not coerce Mary. He invites her trust.
Metaphor
This is the moment of stepping fully into the light.
The dawn has already broken. The light has already entered the room. Now Mary chooses to walk forward rather than retreat back into the shadows. She does not create the light. She responds to it. She aligns her life with the direction the light is already moving.
This is what it means to live after sunrise.
-Quote-
Dietrich Bonhoeffer wrote, “When Christ calls a man, he bids him come and die.” Mary’s obedience is costly, but it is also life-giving. She entrusts herself to God because she trusts the One who has spoken.
-Application-
This slide presses the question closer to us.
Many Christians are comfortable celebrating the incarnation as an event, but hesitate when it begins to rearrange their lives. We rejoice that Christ has come, but we struggle when His coming demands trust, surrender, and obedience.
Mary shows us that faith is not merely believing that God can act, but yielding to His word when He does.
To say “let it be to me according to your word” is to release control. It is to accept that following Christ will sometimes disrupt plans, unsettle assumptions, and expose us to misunderstanding. Yet it is also to trust that the God who brings the dawn knows what He is doing.
Walking in the growing light of Christ means we no longer organise our lives around fear, self-protection, or visibility. We organise them around obedience to God’s word. We take the next faithful step, even when we cannot see the whole road ahead, because the light has already come.
This is not heroism. It is discipleship.
