The Nations Scattered
Genesis 11:1–9
Babel and the Need for Pentecost (Acts 2:1–13)
Introduction
Last time we stood at the edge of a washed world.
We’d walked through the flood narrative, through the covenant with Noah, we saw how serious sin really is. It wasn’t a minor flaw in humanities corruption runs deep.
The flood NOT divine overreaction but a morally necessity.
And yet, grace prevailed:
Noah stepped onto dry ground 
Built an Alter. Worship first then a the practicalities; He built an altar, sacrifices before civilisation did.
Then came the covenant promise. Seedtime and harvest. Summer and winter. Stability in creation. 
And the rainbow, beautiful and a declaration, a warrior’s bow hung up in restraint.
Genesis 10 then spreads the camera wide. Nations, clans, tongues, lands. Humanity spreading outward.
We zoom- in in Genesis 11:
It slows down and things become uncomfortable:
The flood washed the earth but didn’t wash the heart.
So what does unified humanity do, once stability is restored?

GENESIS 11 – THE SCATTERING
1 Now the whole earth had one language and the same words. 2 And as people migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. 1. One Language, One Direction
Genesis 11:1–2
“Now the whole earth had one language and the same words.”
One language. Same vocabulary, 1 shared speech.
It sounds ideal. No miscommunication. No translation issues. No cultural divide.
But Scripture doesn’t present unity as automatically good. Unity amplifies whatever sits at the centre.
If the centre is pride, unity multiplies pride.
V2: “As people migrated from the east, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there.”
They “settled.” NOT temporary. chose permanence.
And Shinar NOT random. becomes Babylon. The seeds are visible.
They’re moving east - In Genesis that’s a symolic drifting away from Eden’s direction.
A current & subtle but a drifting.
~~Metaphor~
It’s like watching a calm river that looks peaceful on the surface. But if you stand still long enough, you see the pull; Something’s carrying them somewhere.
~~Quote~~
Augustine - “societies are shaped by what they love most”. If the chief love is self, the whole structure bends inward. Babel doesn’t start with bricks. It starts with a misdirected love.
~~Application~~
Christ is the Goal, not unity.
We can be united around a platform, a personality or a frustration 
But unless Christ governs the unity, it will drift.

2. Let Us Build
3 And they said to one another, “Come, let us make bricks, and burn them thoroughly.” And they had brick for stone, and bitumen for mortar. 4 Then they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth.”
Genesis 11:3–4
“And they said to one another, ‘Come, let us make bricks…’”
Tone: “Let us.” It’s repeated. -organised ambition. - Autonomy!
They innovate: bricks instead of stone, Bitumen / mortar. 
There’s intelligent creativity. Engineering skill, artistry
So Tech isn’t the problem!
V4 shows the human heart:
“Let US build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed…”
There’ tis “Make a name for ourselves.”
God had already told humanity to spread out and fill the earth, To carry His image across the globe. Instead, they consolidate and fear dispersion. They don’t want the security of dependence; they want security they can control.
This tower, a way of staging access to the heavens in our terms - religious.
They’re trying to “manage” God.
~~Quote~~
Martin Luther :  “sin as the heart curved inward”,  Babel the inward curve scaled up to civilisation.
Genesis 12 comes right after this. God says to Abram, “I will make your name great.” What Babel tries to seize what  God promises to give.
That contrast isn’t accidental.
~~Metaphor~~
Babel is a ladder built without promise. It climbs, but it has no covenant beneath it.
~~Quote~~
John Owen “unbelief refuses to rest in God’s sufficiency. That’s Babel. They don’t trust God to secure them. So they secure themselves.”
~~Application~~
We don’t build not of Insta/FB/X towers of reputation, safety nets, identities, not using brick. But we build reputations. We build safety nets. We build identities that we can point to and say, “See, I’m stable.”
It’s subtle. But when identity comes from construction rather than communion, we’re not far from Shinar/Babilon.
3. The Lord Came Down
5 And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of man had built. 6 And the Lord said, “Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. And nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them.
Genesis 11:5–6
“And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower…”
That line always makes me pause. They’re trying to reach heaven. And God has to come down to inspect it.
The text humbles them without shouting.
It calls them “the children of man.” Not gods. Not cosmic engineers. Children of dust.
Verse 6: “Behold, they are one people… this is only the beginning…”
God recognises something serious. Unified pride scales quickly.
God’s not insecure; He is wise. Sin multiplies faster when it’s collectively affirmed. 
Bonhoeffer warned about collective pride hardening communities. “Once a group baptises its own ambition, correction becomes difficult.”
That’s what we’re seeing here.
~~Metaphor~~
It’s scaffolding around arrogance. Leave it long enough and it becomes a fortress.
~~Application~~
Sometimes when God disrupts plans, we immediately call it opposition. But what if it’s protection?
What if interruption is mercy?
Not every stalled project is a failure. Sometimes it’s divine intervention.

4. Confusion and Scattering
7 Come, let us go down and there confuse their language, so that they may not understand one another's speech.” 8 So the Lord dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city. 9 Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the Lord confused[a] the language of all the earth. And from there the Lord dispersed them over the face of all the earth.
Genesis 11:7–9
“Come, let us go down and there confuse their language…”
There’s that “let us” again. This time divine.
God fractures communication.
And then: “So the LORD dispersed them…”
The very thing they feared becomes reality.
They didn’t want to fill the earth. So God ensures they do.
Judgment accomplishes what command did not.
The city is named Babel. Confusion. And later Babylon becomes the biblical symbol of organised pride.
Augustine spoke of the earthly city glorying in itself. That’s Babel. Self-referential glory.
~~Metaphor~
Imagine a mirror shattering. The image of God is still present in humanity, but now refracted across languages and cultures.
~~Application~~
We live in that fractured world.
Political divide. Cultural suspicion. Class, Linguistic barriers.
But the answer to Babel cannot be better engineering.
It must be divine interventions again.
And that brings us to Acts.

5. Heaven Comes Down
Acts 2:1–4
“When the day of Pentecost arrived…”
Jerusalem is full. Pilgrims from across the known world.
Verse 2:
“Suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind…”
Notice the direction.
At Babel, humanity ascended. Here, heaven descends.
V3: “Divided tongues as of fire appeared…”
Fire signals God’s presence. Sinai echoes. Covenant echoes.
V4:“They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues…”
This isn’t chaotic babble. It’s intelligible language.
God doesn’t erase difference. He empowers communication.
~~Metaphor~
If Babel shattered language like glass, Pentecost sends light through it.
Historic voice
Luther insisted that the gospel must be proclaimed clearly. Pentecost ensures clarity across boundaries.
Application
The church doesn’t overcome division by force or by flattening culture.
It proclaims Christ in the power of the Spirit.

6. Many Languages, One Gospel
Acts 2:5–11 “Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews… from every nation under heaven.”
That phrase echoes Genesis.
V6: “Each one was hearing them speak in his own language.”
Not one language restored. Many languages understood.
!! That’s important !!.
God isn’t reversing Babel by undoing diversity. He’s redeems diversity.
Lists regions across the known world. Parthians. Medes. Elamites. Mesopotamia. It’s a deliberate geographical sweep.
And what are they hearing? “The mighty works of God.”
Not human achievement but divine accomplishment.
John Owen wrote that “the Spirit unites believers to Christ, and therefore to one another.” The unity - not structure or denomination -  It’s spiritual.
~~Metaphor~
Pentecost isn’t rebuilding a tower. It’s forming a body.
~~Application~~
Christian unity doesn’t require sameness. It requires shared union with Christ.

7. Not Our Name But His
Acts 2:12–13 ~ “And all were amazed and perplexed…”
Some are drawn, Others mock.
That hasn’t changed.
But Peter will stand and preach Christ crucified and risen.
At Babel, they tried to make a name.
At Pentecost, the apostles proclaim the Name.
Not self-exaltation. Christ exaltation.
Bonhoeffer said Christ stands at the centre. Pentecost reveals that centre drawing scattered nations inward.
Conclusion
Genesis 11 shows us what humanity does when united in pride.
Acts 2 shows us what God does when He descends in grace.
Babel climbs, Pentecost descends.
Babel builds,  Pentecost proclaims.
But the cross stands between them.
Christ descended lower than Babel’s arrogance. He was lifted up, not to secure His own name apart from the Father, but in obedience.
And Revelation shows the end. A multitude from every nation, tribe, people, and language standing before the throne.
Rev 7:9 ““After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb…””
The categories fractured at Babel are redeemed in Christ.
Augustine “hour hearts are restless until they rest in God.”
Babel is restless[working] construction. Pentecost is Spirit-given proclamation.
The cross is the only ladder that actually reaches heaven.
So the question isn’t abstract.
Are we building upward, or bowing downward?
The at Babel nations were scattered. In Christ, they are gathered.
If you’re building your identity in ethnicity, in gender, in sexuality, in politics, in anything that begins with “this is who I define MYSELF to be,” that’s just another tower on the plain of Shinar.
It won’t reach heaven, its only leads to distruction
Put the bricks down.  Come to the One who came down for you,  Receive the name He gives, Be gathered into His people.

PRAY
*Confess our pride and self-made identity 
* Thank God that He came down in Christ
*Praise Jesus for being lifted up and gathering the scattered
*Thank the Spirit for uniting us to Christ
*Ask for unity rooted in Him, not culture or preference
*bold, clear proclamation of the gospel
*draw restless builders to Himself
* nations would be gathered under Christ’s name

Amen.
