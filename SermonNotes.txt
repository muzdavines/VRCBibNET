The Sentence Is Not Finished
Primary Text: Philippians 1:6
“And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.”

Intro
As a year comes to an end, the pressure to conclude becomes almost instinctive. Calendars close. Reviews are written. Progress is measured. We are conditioned to believe that meaning must be summarised before we are allowed to move on.
Spiritually, that instinct can become dangerous.
Because when a year ends, many people quietly assume that something decisive has happened. Either they have proven something about themselves, or something has been proven against them. Faith becomes evaluated not by promise, but by perception.
In virtual space this instinct can feel amplified. We step into moments of real connection, shared worship, genuine prayer, and then we leave the room. The space remains. The relationships pause. And it is easy to feel that something has ended, even when nothing has been concluded.
Scripture resists that instinct at every turn.
God’s redemptive work is not arranged around calendar boundaries. The Bible does not treat years as theological verdicts. Philippians 1:6 gives us a way to stand at the end of a year without pretending the year was insignificant, but also without letting it carry more authority than it deserves.
A year is not a conclusion.
 It is a clause.

1Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus,
To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons:
2Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
Thanksgiving and Prayer
3I thank my God in all my remembrance of you, 4always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy, 5because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now. 6And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ. 7It is right for me to feel this way about you all, because I hold you in my heart, for you are all partakers with me of grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel. 8For God is my witness, how I yearn for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus. 9And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment, 10so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ, 11filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.

1: God Is the Author of the Sentence
Scripture
“And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you…”
-Exegesis-
Paul opens with certainty, but it is important to see how carefully that certainty is constructed. Paul does not begin with the condition of the Philippians, their obedience, or their perseverance. He begins with God’s action.
The grammar is decisive. God is the subject of the sentence. Everything else flows from that. Paul does not say, “I am sure because you have been faithful,” or “I am sure because you have endured.” He says, “I am sure because God began the work.”
This is not a rhetorical flourish. It is a theological commitment. Paul understands that assurance collapses the moment the believer becomes the primary agent. If the Christian life begins with human resolve, then it must also be sustained by human strength, and eventually justified by human performance.
Paul refuses that entire framework.
The Christian life begins with God’s gracious initiative. God acts first. God lays hold of the sinner. God brings life where there was death. That means the meaning of the Christian life is not determined by how strong the believer feels at the end of a year, but by how faithful God has revealed Himself to be.
- Metaphor - 
Every sentence has an author. Meaning does not come from a single clause read in isolation, but from the intention of the one who is writing. When the author is forgotten, individual lines are misread, overinterpreted, or dismissed entirely. Paul restores clarity by reminding the church that God is the Author of their story, and therefore no single clause can overturn His purpose.
- Quote -
John Calvin writes, “God does not forsake the work of His hands.”
- Application- 
Some of you reach the end of the year rereading certain moments again and again, as though they define everything. Failures echo louder than grace. Regrets feel more authoritative than promise. Philippians 1:6 interrupts that spiral. If God authored the sentence, then you are not free to declare it meaningless because one clause feels weak. Trust the Author more than your interpretation of the line.

2: God Writes Deeply, Not Hastily
Scripture
“…a good work in you…”
-Exegesis-
Paul deliberately locates God’s work “in you.” This moves the focus away from surface-level measures of success. God’s primary concern is not first what can be seen, but what is being formed.
Sanctification is rarely fast. It is rarely linear. It often involves repetition, correction, and long periods where progress is not obvious. Scripture consistently portrays God as patient in His work, committed to depth rather than speed.
This explains why so much of God’s activity feels unfinished at any given moment. Internal transformation does not lend itself to quick summaries. It unfolds over time, through ordinary obedience, repeated repentance, and sustained dependence.
- Metaphor - 
Well-formed sentences are not rushed. They are shaped deliberately, with attention to meaning, rhythm, and coherence. Some clauses feel understated, even dull, when read on their own. But remove them and the sentence collapses. God’s work in His people is like that. What feels unremarkable may be structurally essential.
- Quote -
Augustine prayed, “Lord, you were more inward to me than my innermost self.”
- Application-
If you end the year feeling unchanged, consider whether you are measuring the wrong thing. God may be writing in places you are not looking. Quiet perseverance, unseen repentance, and continued prayer are not filler. They are part of the sentence God is carefully forming. Do not despise slow clauses.

3: The Sentence Has a Middle
Scripture
“…will bring it to completion…”

-Exegesis-
Paul speaks with certainty about completion, but he does not pretend that completion has already arrived. This introduces a crucial category: the middle.
The Christian life has a beginning and a promised end, but most of it is lived between those two points. Scripture never presents the middle as a problem to be solved, but as the place where formation occurs.
The danger at the end of a year is assuming that unfinished means unsuccessful. Paul rejects that assumption. Completion is promised, not immediate. God’s faithfulness is measured by His commitment to finish, not by how resolved things feel at any given moment.
- Metaphor - 
Every sentence has a middle, and the middle often feels awkward when read alone. Meaning is suspended. Resolution is delayed. But the middle is not accidental. It is where the sentence develops weight and direction. Stopping halfway through guarantees misunderstanding.
- Quote -
Martin Luther wrote, “This life therefore is not righteousness, but growth in righteousness.”
- Application-
If you feel unresolved, you are not disqualified. You are living where Scripture says you will live. Faithfulness does not require clarity. It requires trust. Continue reading. Continue obeying. The sentence has not stalled. It is still unfolding.

4: Completion Belongs to Christ’s Day
Scripture
“…at the day of Jesus Christ.”
-Exegesis-
Paul locates completion explicitly in the future, at the return of Christ. This anchors the Christian life in hope rather than immediacy. No year, no season, and no experience is allowed to carry ultimate weight.
This eschatological horizon protects believers from despair and from pride. It reminds us that God has reserved the final evaluation of His work for Christ Himself. The sentence does not reach its final punctuation until the day of Jesus Christ.
- Metaphor - 
The final punctuation of a sentence belongs to the author, not the reader. Readers may pause, reflect, or reread, but they do not decide where the sentence ends. God has reserved the final punctuation for Christ’s return.
- Quote -
Herman Bavinck wrote, “Grace restores nature, not by destroying it, but by bringing it to its true end.”
- Application- 
Do not ask a year to do what only Christ can do. Do not demand closure where God has promised completion later. Live faithfully in the clause you are in, trusting that the Author knows exactly when and how the sentence will end.

Conclusion
Let us hear the sentence again as a whole.
“And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.”
The year ends.
 The sentence does not.
- Application -
As you move from one year into the next, resist premature conclusions. Refuse to let one clause define the whole. Trust the Author. Keep repenting honestly, obeying steadily, praying faithfully, and receiving grace daily.
God has not finished what He began.
The sentence is not finished.
If you want next, we can now pressure-test this against your usual delivery time, or shape a closing VR prayer that allows this to settle without emotional manipulation.
