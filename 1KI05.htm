There is no enemy and no evil occurrence.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Behold, I intend to build a house for the name of Yahweh my God, as Yahweh spoke to David my father, saying, ‘Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place shall build the house for my name.’  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Now therefore command that cedar trees be cut for me out of Lebanon. My servants will be with your servants; and I will give you wages for your servants according to all that you say. For you know that there is nobody among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>When Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly, and said, “Blessed is Yahweh today, who has given to David a wise son to rule over this great people.”  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, “I have heard the message which you have sent to me. I will do all your desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning cypress timber.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>My servants will bring them down from Lebanon to the sea. I will make them into rafts to go by sea to the place that you specify to me, and will cause them to be broken up there, and you will receive them. You will accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So Hiram gave Solomon cedar timber and cypress timber according to all his desire.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand cors<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> 20,000 cors would be about 120,000 bushels or about 4.2 megaliters of wheat, which would weigh about 3,270 metric tons.</span></a> of wheat for food to his household, and twenty cors<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> 20 cors is about 1,100 gallons or about 4220 liters.</span></a> of pure oil.
