Each one had six wings. With two he covered his face. With two he covered his feet. With two he flew.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>One called to another, and said, </div><div class='q'>“Holy, holy, holy, is Yahweh of Armies! </div><div class='q2'>The whole earth is full of his glory!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Then I said, “Woe is me! For I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips and I live among a people of unclean lips, for my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh of Armies!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He touched my mouth with it, and said, “Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin forgiven.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>I heard the Lord’s voice, saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” </div><div class='p'>Then I said, “Here I am. Send me!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>He said, “Go, and tell this people, </div><div class='q'>‘You hear indeed, </div><div class='q2'>but don’t understand. </div><div class='q'>You see indeed, </div><div class='q2'>but don’t perceive.’ </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Make the heart of this people fat. </div><div class='q2'>Make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; </div><div class='q'>lest they see with their eyes, </div><div class='q2'>hear with their ears, </div><div class='q2'>understand with their heart, </div><div class='q2'>and turn again, and be healed.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then I said, “Lord, how long?” </div><div class='p'>He answered, </div><div class='q'>“Until cities are waste without inhabitant, </div><div class='q2'>houses without man, </div><div class='q2'>the land becomes utterly waste, </div><div class='q2'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>and Yahweh has removed men far away, </div><div class='q2'>and the forsaken places are many within the land. </div><div class='q'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>If there is a tenth left in it, </div><div class='q2'>that also will in turn be consumed, </div><div class='q'>as a terebinth, and as an oak whose stump remains when they are cut down, </div><div class='q2'>so the holy seed is its stump.” </div><ul class='tnav'>
