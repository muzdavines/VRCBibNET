Behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>that looked like a jasper stone and a sardius. There was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald to look at.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Around the throne were twenty-four thrones. On the thrones were twenty-four elders sitting, dressed in white garments, with crowns of gold on their heads.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Out of the throne proceed lightnings, sounds, and thunders. There were seven lamps of fire burning before his throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>Before the throne was something like a sea of glass, similar to crystal. In the middle of the throne, and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The first creature was like a lion, the second creature like a calf, the third creature had a face like a man, and the fourth was like a flying eagle.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The four living creatures, each one of them having six wings, are full of eyes around and within. They have no rest day and night, saying, “Holy, holy, holy<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> Hodges/Farstad MT reads “holy” 9 times instead of 3.</span></a> is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come!” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>When the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to him who sits on the throne, to him who lives forever and ever,  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives forever and ever, and throw their crowns before the throne, saying,  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>“Worthy are you, our Lord and God, the Holy One,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">†<span class="popup"> TR omits “and God, the Holy One,”</span></a> to receive the glory, the honor, and the power, for you created all things, and because of your desire they existed and were created!” </div><ul class='tnav'>
