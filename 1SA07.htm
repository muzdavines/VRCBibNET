When the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>The children of Israel said to Samuel, “Don’t stop crying to Yahweh our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the Philistines.”  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Samuel took a suckling lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt offering to Yahweh. Samuel cried to Yahweh for Israel, and Yahweh answered him.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines came near to battle against Israel; but Yahweh thundered with a great thunder on that day on the Philistines and confused them; and they were struck down before Israel.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>The men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and struck them until they came under Beth Kar. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and called its name Ebenezer,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> “Ebenezer” means “stone of help”.</span></a> saying, “Yahweh helped us until now.”  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>So the Philistines were subdued, and they stopped coming within the border of Israel.
