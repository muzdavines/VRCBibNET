Weep with those who weep.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Be of the same mind one toward another. Don’t set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Don’t be wise in your own conceits.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>Repay no one evil for evil. Respect what is honorable in the sight of all men.  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>If it is possible, as much as it is up to you, be at peace with all men.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>Don’t seek revenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to God’s wrath.
