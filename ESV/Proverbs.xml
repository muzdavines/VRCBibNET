<b n="Proverbs">
  <c n="1">
    <v n="1">The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:</v>
    <v n="2">To know wisdom and instruction, to understand words of insight,</v>
    <v n="3">to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness, justice, and equity;</v>
    <v n="4">to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the youth--</v>
    <v n="5">Let the wise hear and increase in learning, and the one who understands obtain guidance,</v>
    <v n="6">to understand a proverb and a saying, the words of the wise and their riddles.</v>
    <v n="7">The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction.</v>
    <v n="8">Hear, my son, your father's instruction, and forsake not your mother's teaching,</v>
    <v n="9">for they are a graceful garland for your head and pendants for your neck.</v>
    <v n="10">My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent.</v>
    <v n="11">If they say, "Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood; let us ambush the innocent without reason;</v>
    <v n="12">like Sheol let us swallow them alive, and whole, like those who go down to the pit;</v>
    <v n="13">we shall find all precious goods, we shall fill our houses with plunder;</v>
    <v n="14">throw in your lot among us; we will all have one purse"--</v>
    <v n="15">my son, do not walk in the way with them; hold back your foot from their paths,</v>
    <v n="16">for their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.</v>
    <v n="17">For in vain is a net spread in the sight of any bird,</v>
    <v n="18">but these men lie in wait for their own blood; they set an ambush for their own lives.</v>
    <v n="19">Such are the ways of everyone who is greedy for unjust gain; it takes away the life of its possessors.</v>
    <v n="20">Wisdom cries aloud in the street, in the markets she raises her voice;</v>
    <v n="21">at the head of the noisy streets she cries out; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks:</v>
    <v n="22">"How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple? How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge?</v>
    <v n="23">If you turn at my reproof, behold, I will pour out my spirit to you; I will make my words known to you.</v>
    <v n="24">Because I have called and you refused to listen, have stretched out my hand and no one has heeded,</v>
    <v n="25">because you have ignored all my counsel and would have none of my reproof,</v>
    <v n="26">I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when terror strikes you,</v>
    <v n="27">when terror strikes you like a storm and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.</v>
    <v n="28">Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently but will not find me.</v>
    <v n="29">Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD,</v>
    <v n="30">would have none of my counsel and despised all my reproof,</v>
    <v n="31">therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way, and have their fill of their own devices.</v>
    <v n="32">For the simple are killed by their turning away, and the complacency of fools destroys them;</v>
    <v n="33">but whoever listens to me will dwell secure and will be at ease, without dread of disaster."</v>
  </c>
  <c n="2">
    <v n="1">My son, if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments with you,</v>
    <v n="2">making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding;</v>
    <v n="3">yes, if you call out for insight and raise your voice for understanding,</v>
    <v n="4">if you seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures,</v>
    <v n="5">then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God.</v>
    <v n="6">For the LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;</v>
    <v n="7">he stores up sound wisdom for the upright; he is a shield to those who walk in integrity,</v>
    <v n="8">guarding the paths of justice and watching over the way of his saints.</v>
    <v n="9">Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity, every good path;</v>
    <v n="10">for wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;</v>
    <v n="11">discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you,</v>
    <v n="12">delivering you from the way of evil, from men of perverted speech,</v>
    <v n="13">who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,</v>
    <v n="14">who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perverseness of evil,</v>
    <v n="15">men whose paths are crooked, and who are devious in their ways.</v>
    <v n="16">So you will be delivered from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words,</v>
    <v n="17">who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God;</v>
    <v n="18">for her house sinks down to death, and her paths to the departed;</v>
    <v n="19">none who go to her come back, nor do they regain the paths of life.</v>
    <v n="20">So you will walk in the way of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous.</v>
    <v n="21">For the upright will inhabit the land, and those with integrity will remain in it,</v>
    <v n="22">but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be rooted out of it.</v>
  </c>
  <c n="3">
    <v n="1">My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments,</v>
    <v n="2">for length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you.</v>
    <v n="3">Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you; bind them around your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart.</v>
    <v n="4">So you will find favor and good success in the sight of God and man.</v>
    <v n="5">Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding.</v>
    <v n="6">In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.</v>
    <v n="7">Be not wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD, and turn away from evil.</v>
    <v n="8">It will be healing to your flesh and refreshment to your bones.</v>
    <v n="9">Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your produce;</v>
    <v n="10">then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will be bursting with wine.</v>
    <v n="11">My son, do not despise the LORD's discipline or be weary of his reproof,</v>
    <v n="12">for the LORD reproves him whom he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights.</v>
    <v n="13">Blessed is the one who finds wisdom, and the one who gets understanding,</v>
    <v n="14">for the gain from her is better than gain from silver and her profit better than gold.</v>
    <v n="15">She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire can compare with her.</v>
    <v n="16">Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor.</v>
    <v n="17">Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</v>
    <v n="18">She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her; those who hold her fast are called blessed.</v>
    <v n="19">The LORD by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens;</v>
    <v n="20">by his knowledge the deeps broke open, and the clouds drop down the dew.</v>
    <v n="21">My son, do not lose sight of these--keep sound wisdom and discretion,</v>
    <v n="22">and they will be life for your soul and adornment for your neck.</v>
    <v n="23">Then you will walk on your way securely, and your foot will not stumble.</v>
    <v n="24">If you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.</v>
    <v n="25">Do not be afraid of sudden terror or of the ruin of the wicked, when it comes,</v>
    <v n="26">for the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being caught.</v>
    <v n="27">Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to do it.</v>
    <v n="28">Do not say to your neighbor, "Go, and come again, tomorrow I will give it"--when you have it with you.</v>
    <v n="29">Do not plan evil against your neighbor, who dwells trustingly beside you.</v>
    <v n="30">Do not contend with a man for no reason, when he has done you no harm.</v>
    <v n="31">Do not envy a man of violence and do not choose any of his ways,</v>
    <v n="32">for the devious person is an abomination to the LORD, but the upright are in his confidence.</v>
    <v n="33">The LORD's curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the dwelling of the righteous.</v>
    <v n="34">Toward the scorners he is scornful, but to the humble he gives favor.</v>
    <v n="35">The wise will inherit honor, but fools get disgrace.</v>
  </c>
  <c n="4">
    <v n="1">Hear, O sons, a father's instruction, and be attentive, that you may gain insight,</v>
    <v n="2">for I give you good precepts; do not forsake my teaching.</v>
    <v n="3">When I was a son with my father, tender, the only one in the sight of my mother,</v>
    <v n="4">he taught me and said to me, "Let your heart hold fast my words; keep my commandments, and live.</v>
    <v n="5">Get wisdom; get insight; do not forget, and do not turn away from the words of my mouth.</v>
    <v n="6">Do not forsake her, and she will keep you; love her, and she will guard you.</v>
    <v n="7">The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom, and whatever you get, get insight.</v>
    <v n="8">Prize her highly, and she will exalt you; she will honor you if you embrace her.</v>
    <v n="9">She will place on your head a graceful garland; she will bestow on you a beautiful crown."</v>
    <v n="10">Hear, my son, and accept my words, that the years of your life may be many.</v>
    <v n="11">I have taught you the way of wisdom; I have led you in the paths of uprightness.</v>
    <v n="12">When you walk, your step will not be hampered, and if you run, you will not stumble.</v>
    <v n="13">Keep hold of instruction; do not let go; guard her, for she is your life.</v>
    <v n="14">Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not walk in the way of the evil.</v>
    <v n="15">Avoid it; do not go on it; turn away from it and pass on.</v>
    <v n="16">For they cannot sleep unless they have done wrong; they are robbed of sleep unless they have made someone stumble.</v>
    <v n="17">For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.</v>
    <v n="18">But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day.</v>
    <v n="19">The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know over what they stumble.</v>
    <v n="20">My son, be attentive to my words; incline your ear to my sayings.</v>
    <v n="21">Let them not escape from your sight; keep them within your heart.</v>
    <v n="22">For they are life to those who find them, and healing to all their flesh.</v>
    <v n="23">Keep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life.</v>
    <v n="24">Put away from you crooked speech, and put devious talk far from you.</v>
    <v n="25">Let your eyes look directly forward, and your gaze be straight before you.</v>
    <v n="26">Ponder the path of your feet; then all your ways will be sure.</v>
    <v n="27">Do not swerve to the right or to the left; turn your foot away from evil.</v>
  </c>
  <c n="5">
    <v n="1">My son, be attentive to my wisdom; incline your ear to my understanding,</v>
    <v n="2">that you may keep discretion, and your lips may guard knowledge.</v>
    <v n="3">For the lips of a forbidden woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil,</v>
    <v n="4">but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.</v>
    <v n="5">Her feet go down to death; her steps follow the path to Sheol;</v>
    <v n="6">she does not ponder the path of life; her ways wander, and she does not know it.</v>
    <v n="7">And now, O sons, listen to me, and do not depart from the words of my mouth.</v>
    <v n="8">Keep your way far from her, and do not go near the door of her house,</v>
    <v n="9">lest you give your honor to others and your years to the merciless,</v>
    <v n="10">lest strangers take their fill of your strength, and your labors go to the house of a foreigner,</v>
    <v n="11">and at the end of your life you groan, when your flesh and body are consumed,</v>
    <v n="12">and you say, "How I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof!</v>
    <v n="13">I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my instructors.</v>
    <v n="14">I am at the brink of utter ruin in the assembled congregation."</v>
    <v n="15">Drink water from your own cistern, flowing water from your own well.</v>
    <v n="16">Should your springs be scattered abroad, streams of water in the streets?</v>
    <v n="17">Let them be for yourself alone, and not for strangers with you.</v>
    <v n="18">Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth,</v>
    <v n="19">a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight; be intoxicated always in her love.</v>
    <v n="20">Why should you be intoxicated, my son, with a forbidden woman and embrace the bosom of an adulteress?</v>
    <v n="21">For a man's ways are before the eyes of the LORD, and he ponders all his paths.</v>
    <v n="22">The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him, and he is held fast in the cords of his sin.</v>
    <v n="23">He dies for lack of discipline, and because of his great folly he is led astray.</v>
  </c>
  <c n="6">
    <v n="1">My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, have given your pledge for a stranger,</v>
    <v n="2">if you are snared in the words of your mouth, caught in the words of your mouth,</v>
    <v n="3">then do this, my son, and save yourself, for you have come into the hand of your neighbor: go, hasten, and plead urgently with your neighbor.</v>
    <v n="4">Give your eyes no sleep and your eyelids no slumber;</v>
    <v n="5">save yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the hand of the fowler.</v>
    <v n="6">Go to the ant, O sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise.</v>
    <v n="7">Without having any chief, officer, or ruler,</v>
    <v n="8">she prepares her bread in summer and gathers her food in harvest.</v>
    <v n="9">How long will you lie there, O sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep?</v>
    <v n="10">A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,</v>
    <v n="11">and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man.</v>
    <v n="12">A worthless person, a wicked man, goes about with crooked speech,</v>
    <v n="13">winks with his eyes, signals with his feet, points with his finger,</v>
    <v n="14">with perverted heart devises evil, continually sowing discord;</v>
    <v n="15">therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in a moment he will be broken beyond healing.</v>
    <v n="16">There are six things that the LORD hates, seven that are an abomination to him:</v>
    <v n="17">haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</v>
    <v n="18">a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil,</v>
    <v n="19">a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers.</v>
    <v n="20">My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not your mother's teaching.</v>
    <v n="21">Bind them on your heart always; tie them around your neck.</v>
    <v n="22">When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk with you.</v>
    <v n="23">For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life,</v>
    <v n="24">to preserve you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the adulteress.</v>
    <v n="25">Do not desire her beauty in your heart, and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes;</v>
    <v n="26">for the price of a prostitute is only a loaf of bread, but a married woman hunts down a precious life.</v>
    <v n="27">Can a man carry fire next to his chest and his clothes not be burned?</v>
    <v n="28">Or can one walk on hot coals and his feet not be scorched?</v>
    <v n="29">So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife; none who touches her will go unpunished.</v>
    <v n="30">People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his appetite when he is hungry,</v>
    <v n="31">but if he is caught, he will pay sevenfold; he will give all the goods of his house.</v>
    <v n="32">He who commits adultery lacks sense; he who does it destroys himself.</v>
    <v n="33">Wounds and dishonor will he get, and his disgrace will not be wiped away.</v>
    <v n="34">For jealousy makes a man furious, and he will not spare when he takes revenge.</v>
    <v n="35">He will accept no compensation; he will refuse though you multiply gifts.</v>
  </c>
  <c n="7">
    <v n="1">My son, keep my words and treasure up my commandments with you;</v>
    <v n="2">keep my commandments and live; keep my teaching as the apple of your eye;</v>
    <v n="3">bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart.</v>
    <v n="4">Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," and call insight your intimate friend,</v>
    <v n="5">to keep you from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words.</v>
    <v n="6">For at the window of my house I have looked out through my lattice,</v>
    <v n="7">and I have seen among the simple, I have perceived among the youths, a young man lacking sense,</v>
    <v n="8">passing along the street near her corner, taking the road to her house</v>
    <v n="9">in the twilight, in the evening, at the time of night and darkness.</v>
    <v n="10">And behold, the woman meets him, dressed as a prostitute, wily of heart.</v>
    <v n="11">She is loud and wayward; her feet do not stay at home;</v>
    <v n="12">now in the street, now in the market, and at every corner she lies in wait.</v>
    <v n="13">She seizes him and kisses him, and with bold face she says to him,</v>
    <v n="14">"I had to offer sacrifices, and today I have paid my vows;</v>
    <v n="15">so now I have come out to meet you, to seek you eagerly, and I have found you.</v>
    <v n="16">I have spread my couch with coverings, colored linens from Egyptian linen;</v>
    <v n="17">I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</v>
    <v n="18">Come, let us take our fill of love till morning; let us delight ourselves with love.</v>
    <v n="19">For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey;</v>
    <v n="20">he took a bag of money with him; at full moon he will come home."</v>
    <v n="21">With much seductive speech she persuades him; with her smooth talk she compels him.</v>
    <v n="22">All at once he follows her, as an ox goes to the slaughter, or as a stag is caught fast</v>
    <v n="23">till an arrow pierces its liver; as a bird rushes into a snare; he does not know that it will cost him his life.</v>
    <v n="24">And now, O sons, listen to me, and be attentive to the words of my mouth.</v>
    <v n="25">Let not your heart turn aside to her ways; do not stray into her paths,</v>
    <v n="26">for many a victim has she laid low, and all her slain are a mighty throng.</v>
    <v n="27">Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death.</v>
  </c>
  <c n="8">
    <v n="1">Does not wisdom call? Does not understanding raise her voice?</v>
    <v n="2">On the heights beside the way, at the crossroads she takes her stand;</v>
    <v n="3">beside the gates in front of the town, at the entrance of the portals she cries aloud:</v>
    <v n="4">"To you, O men, I call, and my cry is to the children of man.</v>
    <v n="5">O simple ones, learn prudence; O fools, learn sense.</v>
    <v n="6">Hear, for I will speak noble things, and from my lips will come what is right,</v>
    <v n="7">for my mouth will utter truth; wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</v>
    <v n="8">All the words of my mouth are righteous; there is nothing twisted or crooked in them.</v>
    <v n="9">They are all straight to him who understands, and right to those who find knowledge.</v>
    <v n="10">Take my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold,</v>
    <v n="11">for wisdom is better than jewels, and all that you may desire cannot compare with her.</v>
    <v n="12">"I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion.</v>
    <v n="13">The fear of the LORD is hatred of evil. Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate.</v>
    <v n="14">I have counsel and sound wisdom; I have insight; I have strength.</v>
    <v n="15">By me kings reign, and rulers decree what is just;</v>
    <v n="16">by me princes rule, and nobles, all who govern justly.</v>
    <v n="17">I love those who love me, and those who seek me diligently find me.</v>
    <v n="18">Riches and honor are with me, enduring wealth and righteousness.</v>
    <v n="19">My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold, and my yield than choice silver.</v>
    <v n="20">I walk in the way of righteousness, in the paths of justice,</v>
    <v n="21">granting an inheritance to those who love me, and filling their treasuries.</v>
    <v n="22">"The LORD possessed me at the beginning of his work, the first of his acts of old.</v>
    <v n="23">Ages ago I was set up, at the first, before the beginning of the earth.</v>
    <v n="24">When there were no depths I was brought forth, when there were no springs abounding with water.</v>
    <v n="25">Before the mountains had been shaped, before the hills, I was brought forth,</v>
    <v n="26">before he had made the earth with its fields, or the first of the dust of the world.</v>
    <v n="27">When he established the heavens, I was there; when he drew a circle on the face of the deep,</v>
    <v n="28">when he made firm the skies above, when he established the fountains of the deep,</v>
    <v n="29">when he assigned to the sea its limit, so that the waters might not transgress his command, when he marked out the foundations of the earth,</v>
    <v n="30">then I was beside him, like a master workman, and I was daily his delight, rejoicing before him always,</v>
    <v n="31">rejoicing in his inhabited world and delighting in the children of man.</v>
    <v n="32">"And now, O sons, listen to me: blessed are those who keep my ways.</v>
    <v n="33">Hear instruction and be wise, and do not neglect it.</v>
    <v n="34">Blessed is the one who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting beside my doors.</v>
    <v n="35">For whoever finds me finds life and obtains favor from the LORD,</v>
    <v n="36">but he who fails to find me injures himself; all who hate me love death."</v>
  </c>
  <c n="9">
    <v n="1">Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn her seven pillars.</v>
    <v n="2">She has slaughtered her beasts; she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table.</v>
    <v n="3">She has sent out her young women to call from the highest places in the town,</v>
    <v n="4">"Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!" To him who lacks sense she says,</v>
    <v n="5">"Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine I have mixed.</v>
    <v n="6">Leave your simple ways, and live, and walk in the way of insight."</v>
    <v n="7">Whoever corrects a scoffer gets himself abuse, and he who reproves a wicked man incurs injury.</v>
    <v n="8">Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you; reprove a wise man, and he will love you.</v>
    <v n="9">Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser; teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.</v>
    <v n="10">The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight.</v>
    <v n="11">For by me your days will be multiplied, and years will be added to your life.</v>
    <v n="12">If you are wise, you are wise for yourself; if you scoff, you alone will bear it.</v>
    <v n="13">The woman Folly is loud; she is seductive and knows nothing.</v>
    <v n="14">She sits at the door of her house; she takes a seat on the highest places of the town,</v>
    <v n="15">calling to those who pass by, who are going straight on their way,</v>
    <v n="16">"Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!" And to him who lacks sense she says,</v>

    <v n="4">The words of a man's mouth are deep waters; the fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook.</v>
    <v n="5">It is not good to be partial to the wicked or to deprive the righteous of justice.</v>
    <v n="6">A fool's lips walk into a fight, and his mouth invites a beating.</v>
    <v n="7">A fool's mouth is his ruin, and his lips are a snare to his soul.</v>
    <v n="8">The words of a whisperer are like delicious morsels; they go down into the inner parts of the body.</v>
    <v n="9">Whoever is slack in his work is a brother to him who destroys.</v>
    <v n="10">The name of the LORD is a strong tower; the righteous man runs into it and is safe.</v>

    <v n="17">The one who states his case first seems right, until the other comes and examines him.</v>
    <v n="18">The lot puts an end to quarrels and decides between powerful contenders.</v>
    <v n="19">A brother offended is more unyielding than a strong city, and quarreling is like the bars of a castle.</v>
    <v n="20">From the fruit of a man's mouth his stomach is satisfied; he is satisfied by the yield of his lips.</v>
    <v n="21">Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruits.</v>
    <v n="22">He who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the LORD.</v>

    <v n="1">Better is a poor person who walks in his integrity than one who is crooked in speech and is a fool.</v>
    <v n="2">Desire without knowledge is not good, and whoever makes haste with his feet misses his way.</v>
    <v n="3">When a man's folly brings his way to ruin, his heart rages against the LORD.</v>
    <v n="4">Wealth brings many new friends, but a poor man is deserted by his friend.</v>

    <v n="23">The fear of the LORD leads to life, and whoever has it rests satisfied; he will not be visited by harm.</v>
    <v n="24">The sluggard buries his hand in the dish and will not even bring it back to his mouth.</v>
    <v n="25">Strike a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence; reprove a man of understanding, and he will gain knowledge.</v>
    <v n="26">He who does violence to his father and chases away his mother is a son who brings shame and reproach.</v>
    <v n="27">Cease to hear instruction, my son, and you will stray from the words of knowledge.</v>

    <v n="3">It is an honor for a man to keep aloof from strife, but every fool will be quarreling.</v>
    <v n="4">The sluggard does not plow in the autumn; he will seek at harvest and have nothing.</v>

    <v n="9">Who can say, "I have made my heart pure; I am clean from my sin"?</v>
    <v n="10">Unequal weights and unequal measures are both alike an abomination to the LORD.</v>
    <v n="11">Even a child makes himself known by his acts, by whether his conduct is pure and upright.</v>
    <v n="12">The hearing ear and the seeing eye, the LORD has made them both.</v>

    <v n="15">There is gold and abundance of costly stones, but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.</v>
    <v n="16">Take a man's garment when he has put up security for a stranger, and hold it in pledge when he puts up security for foreigners.</v>
    <v n="17">Bread gained by deceit is sweet to a man, but afterward his mouth will be full of gravel.</v>
    <v n="18">Plans are established by counsel; by wise guidance wage war.</v>
    <v n="19">Whoever goes about slandering reveals secrets; therefore do not associate with a simple babbler.</v>
    <v n="20">If one curses his father or his mother, his lamp will be put out in utter darkness.</v>
    <v n="21">An inheritance gained hastily in the beginning will not be blessed in the end.</v>
    <v n="22">Do not say, "I will repay evil"; wait for the LORD, and he will deliver you.</v>
    <v n="23">Unequal weights are an abomination to the LORD, and false scales are not good.</v>
    <v n="24">A man's steps are from the LORD; how then can man understand his way?</v>
    <v n="25">It is a snare to say rashly, "It is holy," and to reflect only after making vows.</v>
    <v n="26">A wise king winnows the wicked and drives the wheel over them.</v>
    <v n="27">The spirit of man is the lamp of the LORD, searching all his innermost parts.</v>
    <v n="28">Steadfast love and faithfulness preserve the king, and by steadfast love his throne is upheld.</v>

    <v n="2">Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, but the LORD weighs the heart.</v>
    <v n="3">To do righteousness and justice is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.</v>
    <v n="4">Haughty eyes and a proud heart, the lamp of the wicked, are sin.</v>
    <v n="5">The plans of the diligent lead surely to abundance, but everyone who is hasty comes only to poverty.</v>
    <v n="6">The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor and a snare of death.</v>
    <v n="7">The violence of the wicked will sweep them away, because they refuse to do what is just.</v>
    <v n="8">The way of the guilty is crooked, but the conduct of the pure is upright.</v>
    <v n="9">It is better to live in a corner of the housetop than in a house shared with a quarrelsome wife.</v>
    <v n="10">The soul of the wicked desires evil; his neighbor finds no mercy in his eyes.</v>
    <v n="11">When a scoffer is punished, the simple becomes wise; when a wise man is instructed, he gains knowledge.</v>
    <v n="12">The Righteous One observes the house of the wicked; he throws the wicked down to ruin.</v>
    <v n="13">Whoever closes his ear to the cry of the poor will himself call out and not be answered.</v>
    <v n="14">A gift in secret averts anger, and a concealed bribe, strong wrath.</v>
    <v n="15">When justice is done, it is a joy to the righteous but terror to evildoers.</v>
    <v n="16">One who wanders from the way of good sense will rest in the assembly of the dead.</v>

    <v n="18">The wicked is a ransom for the righteous, and the traitor for the upright.</v>
    <v n="19">It is better to live in a desert land than with a quarrelsome and fretful woman.</v>
    <v n="20">Precious treasure and oil are in a wise man's dwelling, but a foolish man devours it.</v>
    <v n="21">Whoever pursues righteousness and kindness will find life, righteousness, and honor.</v>
    <v n="22">A wise man scales the city of the mighty and brings down the stronghold in which they trust.</v>
    <v n="23">Whoever keeps his mouth and his tongue keeps himself out of trouble.</v>
    <v n="24">"Scoffer" is the name of the arrogant, haughty man who acts with arrogant pride.</v>
    <v n="25">The desire of the sluggard kills him, for his hands refuse to labor.</v>
    <v n="26">All day long he craves and craves, but the righteous gives and does not hold back.</v>
    <v n="27">The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination; how much more when he brings it with evil intent.</v>
    <v n="28">A false witness will perish, but the word of a man who hears will endure.</v>
    <v n="29">A wicked man puts on a bold face, but the upright gives thought to his ways.</v>
    <v n="30">No wisdom, no understanding, no counsel can avail against the LORD.</v>
    <v n="31">The horse is made ready for the day of battle, but the victory belongs to the LORD.</v>

  <c n="22">
    <v n="1">A good name is to be chosen rather than great riches, and favor is better than silver or gold.</v>
    <v n="2">The rich and the poor meet together; the LORD is the maker of them all.</v>
    <v n="3">The prudent sees danger and hides himself, but the simple go on and suffer for it.</v>
    <v n="4">The reward for humility and fear of the LORD is riches and honor and life.</v>
    <v n="5">Thorns and snares are in the way of the crooked; whoever guards his soul will keep far from them.</v>
    <v n="6">Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old he will not depart from it.</v>
    <v n="7">The rich rules over the poor, and the borrower is the slave of the lender.</v>
    <v n="8">Whoever sows injustice will reap calamity, and the rod of his fury will fail.</v>
    <v n="9">Whoever has a bountiful eye will be blessed, for he shares his bread with the poor.</v>
    <v n="10">Drive out a scoffer, and strife will go out, and quarreling and abuse will cease.</v>
    <v n="11">He who loves purity of heart, and whose speech is gracious, will have the king as his friend.</v>
    <v n="12">The eyes of the LORD keep watch over knowledge, but he overthrows the words of the traitor.</v>
    <v n="13">The sluggard says, "There is a lion outside! I shall be killed in the streets!"</v>
    <v n="14">The mouth of forbidden women is a deep pit; he with whom the LORD is angry will fall into it.</v>
    <v n="15">Folly is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of discipline drives it far from him.</v>
    <v n="16">Whoever oppresses the poor to increase his own wealth, or gives to the rich, will only come to poverty.</v>
    <v n="17">Incline your ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply your heart to my knowledge,</v>

    <v n="19">That your trust may be in the LORD, I have made them known to you today, even to you.</v>
    <v n="20">Have I not written for you thirty sayings of counsel and knowledge,</v>

    <v n="26">Be not one of those who give pledges, who put up security for debts.</v>
    <v n="27">If you have nothing with which to pay, why should your bed be taken from under you?</v>
    <v n="28">Do not move the ancient landmark that your fathers have set.</v>

    <v n="6">Do not eat the bread of a man who is stingy; do not desire his delicacies,</v>
    <v n="7">for he is like one who is inwardly calculating. "Eat and drink!" he says to you, but his heart is not with you.</v>
    <v n="8">You will vomit up the morsels that you have eaten, and waste your pleasant words.</v>
    <v n="9">Do not speak in the hearing of a fool, for he will despise the good sense of your words.</v>
    <v n="10">Do not move an ancient landmark or enter the fields of the fatherless,</v>
    <v n="11">for their Redeemer is strong; he will plead their cause against you.</v>
    <v n="12">Apply your heart to instruction and your ear to words of knowledge.</v>
    <v n="13">Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you strike him with a rod, he will not die.</v>

    <v n="19">Hear, my son, and be wise, and direct your heart in the way.</v>
    <v n="20">Be not among drunkards or among gluttonous eaters of meat,</v>
    <v n="21">for the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty, and slumber will clothe them with rags.</v>
    <v n="22">Listen to your father who gave you life, and do not despise your mother when she is old.</v>
    <v n="23">Buy truth, and do not sell it; buy wisdom, instruction, and understanding.</v>
    <v n="24">The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice; he who fathers a wise son will be glad in him.</v>
    <v n="25">Let your father and mother be glad; let her who bore you rejoice.</v>
    <v n="26">My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes observe my ways.</v>
    <v n="27">For a prostitute is a deep pit; an adulteress is a narrow well.</v>

    <v n="6">Do not put yourself forward in the king's presence or stand in the place of the great,</v>

    <v n="3">A poor man who oppresses the poor is a beating rain that leaves no food.</v>
    <v n="4">Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, but those who keep the law strive against them.</v>
    <v n="5">Evil men do not understand justice, but those who seek the LORD understand it completely.</v>
    <v n="6">Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity than a rich man who is crooked in his ways.</v>

    <v n="12">When the righteous triumph, there is great glory, but when the wicked rise, people hide themselves.</v>

    <v n="20">A faithful man will abound with blessings, but whoever hastens to be rich will not go unpunished.</v>
    <v n="21">To show partiality is not good, but for a piece of bread a man will do wrong.</v>
    <v n="22">A stingy man hastens after wealth and does not know that poverty will come upon him.</v>

    <v n="5">A man who flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his feet.</v>
    <v n="6">An evil man is ensnared in his transgression, but a righteous man sings and rejoices.</v>
    <v n="7">A righteous man knows the rights of the poor; a wicked man does not understand such knowledge.</v>
    <v n="8">Scoffers set a city aflame, but the wise turn away wrath.</v>
    <v n="9">If a wise man has an argument with a fool, the fool only rages and laughs, and there is no quiet.</v>
    <v n="10">Bloodthirsty men hate one who is blameless and seek the life of the upright.</v>

    <v n="18">Where there is no prophetic vision the people cast off restraint, but blessed is he who keeps the law.</v>

    <v n="20">Do you see a man who is hasty in his words? There is more hope for a fool than for him.</v>
    <v n="21">Whoever pampers his servant from childhood will in the end find him his heir.</v>
    <v n="22">A man of wrath stirs up strife, and one given to anger causes much transgression.</v>
    <v n="23">One's pride will bring him low, but he who is lowly in spirit will obtain honor.</v>
    <v n="24">The partner of a thief hates his own life; he hears the curse, but discloses nothing.</v>
    <v n="25">The fear of man lays a snare, but whoever trusts in the LORD is safe.</v>
    <v n="26">Many seek the face of a ruler, but it is from the LORD that a man gets justice.</v>

    <v n="1">The words of Agur son of Jakeh. The oracle. The man declares, I am weary, O God; I am weary, O God, and worn out.</v>
    <v n="2">Surely I am too stupid to be a man. I have not the understanding of a man.</v>
    <v n="3">I have not learned wisdom, nor have I knowledge of the Holy One.</v>
    <v n="4">Who has ascended to heaven and come down? Who has gathered the wind in his fists? Who has wrapped up the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his son's name? Surely you know!</v>
    <v n="5">Every word of God proves true; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.</v>
    <v n="6">Do not add to his words, lest he rebuke you and you be found a liar.</v>
    <v n="7">Two things I ask of you; deny them not to me before I die:</v>
    <v n="8">Remove far from me falsehood and lying; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that is needful for me,</v>
    <v n="9">lest I be full and deny you and say, "Who is the LORD?" or lest I be poor and steal and profane the name of my God.</v>
    <v n="10">Do not slander a servant to his master, lest he curse you and you be held guilty.</v>
    <v n="11">There are those who curse their fathers and do not bless their mothers.</v>
    <v n="12">There are those who are clean in their own eyes but are not washed of their filth.</v>
    <v n="13">There are those--how lofty are their eyes, how high their eyelids lift!</v>
    <v n="14">There are those whose teeth are swords, whose fangs are knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, the needy from among mankind.</v>
    <v n="15">The leech has two daughters; "Give" and "Give," they cry. Three things are never satisfied; four never say, "Enough":</v>
    <v n="16">Sheol, the barren womb, the land never satisfied with water, and the fire that never says, "Enough."</v>
    <v n="17">The eye that mocks a father and scorns to obey a mother will be picked out by the ravens of the valley and eaten by the vultures.</v>
    <v n="18">Three things are too wonderful for me; four I do not understand:</v>
    <v n="19">the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a serpent on a rock, the way of a ship on the high seas, and the way of a man with a virgin.</v>
    <v n="20">This is the way of an adulteress: she eats and wipes her mouth and says, "I have done no wrong."</v>
    <v n="21">Under three things the earth trembles; under four it cannot bear up:</v>
    <v n="22">a slave when he becomes king, and a fool when he is filled with food;</v>
    <v n="23">an unloved woman when she gets a husband, and a maidservant when she displaces her mistress.</v>
    <v n="24">Four things on earth are small, but they are exceedingly wise:</v>
    <v n="25">the ants are a people not strong, yet they provide their food in the summer;</v>
    <v n="26">the rock badgers are a people not mighty, yet they make their homes in the cliffs;</v>
    <v n="27">the locusts have no king, yet all of them march in rank;</v>
    <v n="28">the lizard you can take in your hands, yet it is in kings' palaces.</v>
    <v n="29">Three things are stately in their tread; four are stately in their stride:</v>
    <v n="30">the lion, which is mightiest among beasts and does not turn back before any;</v>
    <v n="31">the strutting rooster, the he-goat, and a king whose army is with him.</v>
    <v n="32">If you have been foolish, exalting yourself, or if you have been devising evil, put your hand on your mouth.</v>
    <v n="33">For pressing milk produces curds, pressing the nose produces blood, and pressing anger produces strife.</v>

    <v n="1">The words of King Lemuel. An oracle that his mother taught him:</v>
    <v n="2">What are you doing, my son? What are you doing, son of my womb? What are you doing, son of my vows?</v>
    <v n="3">Do not give your strength to women, your ways to those who destroy kings.</v>
    <v n="4">It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, or for rulers to take strong drink,</v>
    <v n="5">lest they drink and forget what has been decreed and pervert the rights of all the afflicted.</v>
    <v n="6">Give strong drink to the one who is perishing, and wine to those in bitter distress;</v>
    <v n="7">let them drink and forget their poverty and remember their misery no more.</v>
    <v n="8">Open your mouth for the mute, for the rights of all who are destitute.</v>
    <v n="9">Open your mouth, judge righteously, defend the rights of the poor and needy.</v>
    <v n="10">An excellent wife who can find? She is far more precious than jewels.</v>
    <v n="11">The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he will have no lack of gain.</v>
    <v n="12">She does him good, and not harm, all the days of her life.</v>
    <v n="13">She seeks wool and flax, and works with willing hands.</v>
    <v n="14">She is like the ships of the merchant; she brings her food from afar.</v>
    <v n="15">She rises while it is yet night and provides food for her household and portions for her maidens.</v>
    <v n="16">She considers a field and buys it; with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.</v>
    <v n="17">She dresses herself with strength and makes her arms strong.</v>
    <v n="18">She perceives that her merchandise is profitable. Her lamp does not go out at night.</v>
    <v n="19">She puts her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle.</v>
    <v n="20">She opens her hand to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy.</v>
    <v n="21">She is not afraid of snow for her household, for all her household are clothed in scarlet.</v>
    <v n="22">She makes bed coverings for herself; her clothing is fine linen and purple.</v>
    <v n="23">Her husband is known in the gates when he sits among the elders of the land.</v>
    <v n="24">She makes linen garments and sells them; she delivers sashes to the merchant.</v>
    <v n="25">Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laughs at the time to come.</v>
    <v n="26">She opens her mouth with wisdom, and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue.</v>
    <v n="27">She looks well to the ways of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness.</v>
    <v n="28">Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her:</v>
    <v n="29">"Many women have done excellently, but you surpass them all."</v>
    <v n="30">Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.</v>
    <v n="31">Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her works praise her in the gates.</v>
