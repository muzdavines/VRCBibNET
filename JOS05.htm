Yahweh swore to them that he wouldn’t let them see the land which Yahweh swore to their fathers that he would give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>Their children, whom he raised up in their place, were circumcised by Joshua, for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them on the way.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>When they were done circumcising the whole nation, they stayed in their places in the camp until they were healed. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Yahweh said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you.” Therefore the name of that place was called Gilgal<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> “Gilgal” sounds like the Hebrew for “roll.”</span></a> to this day.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>The children of Israel encamped in Gilgal. They kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>They ate unleavened cakes and parched grain of the produce of the land on the next day after the Passover, in the same day.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>The manna ceased on the next day, after they had eaten of the produce of the land. The children of Israel didn’t have manna any more, but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood in front of him with his sword drawn in his hand.
