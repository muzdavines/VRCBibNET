Indeed, you aren’t ready even now,  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren’t you fleshly, and don’t you walk in the ways of men?  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” aren’t you fleshly? </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed, and each as the Lord gave to him?  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>I planted. Apollos watered. But God gave the increase.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>For we are God’s fellow workers. You are God’s farming, God’s building. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or straw,  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>each man’s work will be revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man’s work is.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>If any man’s work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>If any man’s work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Don’t you know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit lives in you?  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him; for God’s temple is holy, which you are. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool that he may become wise.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, “He has taken the wise in their craftiness.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Job 5:13</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V20">20&#160;</span>And again, “The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless.”<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Psalm 94:11</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V21">21&#160;</span>Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,  <span class="verse" id="V22">22&#160;</span>whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All are yours,  <span class="verse" id="V23">23&#160;</span>and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s. </div><ul class='tnav'>
