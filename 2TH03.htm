For we didn’t behave ourselves rebelliously among you,  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>neither did we eat bread from anyone’s hand without paying for it, but in labor and travail worked night and day, that we might not burden any of you.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>This was not because we don’t have the right, but to make ourselves an example to you, that you should imitate us.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For even when we were with you, we commanded you this: “If anyone is not willing to work, don’t let him eat.”  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>For we hear of some who walk among you in rebellion, who don’t work at all, but are busybodies.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Now those who are that way, we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that they work with quietness and eat their own bread. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>But you, brothers, don’t be weary in doing what is right.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>If any man doesn’t obey our word in this letter, note that man and have no company with him, to the end that he may be ashamed.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>Don’t count him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways.
