He commanded the book of records of the chronicles to be brought, and they were read to the king.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>It was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs, who were doorkeepers, who had tried to lay hands on the King Ahasuerus.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>The king said, “What honor and dignity has been given to Mordecai for this?” </div><div class='p'>Then the king’s servants who attended him said, “Nothing has been done for him.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>The king said, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman had come into the outer court of the king’s house, to speak to the king about hanging Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>The king’s servants said to him, “Behold,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> “Behold”, from “הִנֵּה”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at.
