For you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job has.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did what Yahweh commanded them, and Yahweh accepted Job. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Yahweh restored Job’s prosperity when he prayed for his friends. Yahweh gave Job twice as much as he had before.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Then all his brothers, all his sisters, and all those who had been of his acquaintance before, came to him and ate bread with him in his house. They comforted him, and consoled him concerning all the evil that Yahweh had brought on him. Everyone also gave him a piece of money,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> literally, kesitah, a unit of money, probably silver</span></a> and everyone a ring of gold. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>So Yahweh blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning. He had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, one thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand female donkeys.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>He had also seven sons and three daughters.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>He called the name of the first, Jemimah; and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren Happuch.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>In all the land were no women found so beautiful as the daughters of Job. Their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>After this Job lived one hundred forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, to four generations.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>So Job died, being old and full of days. </div><ul class='tnav'>
