Therefore it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law,  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was warned by God when he was about to make the tabernacle, for he said, “See, you shall make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain.”<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">✡<span class="popup"> Exodus 25:40</span></a>  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, by as much as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which on better promises has been given as law. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For finding fault with them, he said, </div><div class='q'>“Behold,<a href="#FN2" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> “Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at.
