I will praise your name, for you have done wonderful things, things planned long ago, in complete faithfulness and truth.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>For you have made a city into a heap, a fortified city into a ruin, a palace of strangers to be no city. It will never be built.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Therefore a strong people will glorify you. A city of awesome nations will fear you.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>For you have been a stronghold to the poor, a stronghold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the dreaded ones is like a storm against the wall.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>As the heat in a dry place you will bring down the noise of strangers; as the heat by the shade of a cloud, the song of the dreaded ones will be brought low. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>In this mountain, Yahweh of Armies will make all peoples a feast of choice meat,<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> literally, fat things</span></a> a feast of choice wines, of choice meat full of marrow, of well refined choice wines.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>He will destroy in this mountain the surface of the covering that covers all peoples, and the veil that is spread over all nations.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>He has swallowed up death forever!
