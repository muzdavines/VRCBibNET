But wrath has come on them to the uttermost. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>But we, brothers, being bereaved of you for a short season in presence, not in heart, tried even harder to see your face with great desire,  <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>because we wanted to come to you—indeed, I, Paul, once and again—but Satan hindered us.  <span class="verse" id="V19">19&#160;</span>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing?
