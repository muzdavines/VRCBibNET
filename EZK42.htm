Then he brought me into the room that was opposite the separate place, and which was opposite the building toward the north.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Facing the length of one hundred cubits<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> A cubit is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the elbow on a man’s arm, or about 18 inches or 46 centimeters.</span></a> was the north door, and the width was fifty cubits.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Opposite the twenty cubits which belonged to the inner court, and opposite the pavement which belonged to the outer court, was gallery against gallery in the three stories.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Before the rooms was a walk of ten cubits’ width inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Now the upper rooms were shorter; for the galleries took away from these more than from the lower and the middle in the building.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>For they were in three stories, and they didn’t have pillars as the pillars of the courts. Therefore the uppermost was set back more than the lowest and the middle from the ground.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The wall that was outside by the side of the rooms, toward the outer court before the rooms, was fifty cubits long.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For the length of the rooms that were in the outer court was fifty cubits.

Their length and width were the same. All their exits had the same arrangement and doors.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>Like the doors of the rooms that were toward the south was a door at the head of the way, even the way directly before the wall toward the east, as one enters into them. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Then he said to me, “The north rooms and the south rooms, which are opposite the separate place, are the holy rooms, where the priests who are near to Yahweh shall eat the most holy things. There they shall lay the most holy things, with the meal offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>When the priests enter in, then they shall not go out of the holy place into the outer court until they lay their garments in which they minister there; for they are holy.

It had a wall around it, the length five hundred cubits, and the width five hundred cubits, to make a separation between that which was holy and that which was common. </div><ul class='tnav'>
