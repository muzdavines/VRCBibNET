The key to the pit of the abyss was given to him.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>He opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke from a<a href="#FN1" class="notemark">*<span class="popup"> TR adds “great”</span></a> burning furnace. The sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>Then out of the smoke came locusts on the earth, and power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>They were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only those people who don’t have God’s seal on their foreheads.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>They were given power, not to kill them, but to torment them for five months. Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a person.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>In those days people will seek death, and will in no way find it.

On their heads were something like golden crowns, and their faces were like people’s faces.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>They had hair like women’s hair, and their teeth were like those of lions.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>They had breastplates like breastplates of iron. The sound of their wings was like the sound of many chariots and horses rushing to war.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They have tails like those of scorpions, with stingers. In their tails they have power to harm men for five months.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>They have over them as king the angel of the abyss.
