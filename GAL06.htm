God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Let’s not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season if we don’t give up.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>So then, as we have opportunity, let’s do what is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>As many as desire to make a good impression in the flesh compel you to be circumcised, just so they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>For even they who receive circumcision don’t keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, so that they may boast in your flesh.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>As many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on God’s Israel. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V18">18&#160;</span>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers.
