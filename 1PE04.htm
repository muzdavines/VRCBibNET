If anyone serves, let it be as of the strength which God supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever.

On their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is glorified.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evil doer, or a meddler in other men’s matters.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>But if one of you suffers for being a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God in this matter.  <span class="verse" id="V17">17&#160;</span>For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God.
