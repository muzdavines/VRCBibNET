This is vanity, and it is an evil disease. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>If a man fathers a hundred children, and lives many years, so that the days of his years are many, but his soul is not filled with good, and moreover he has no burial, I say that a stillborn child is better than he;  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>for it comes in vanity, and departs in darkness, and its name is covered with darkness.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>Moreover it has not seen the sun nor known it.
