Someone said, “Rise and measure God’s temple, and the altar, and those who worship in it.  <span class="verse" id="V2">2&#160;</span>Leave out the court which is outside of the temple, and don’t measure it, for it has been given to the nations. They will tread the holy city under foot for forty-two months.  <span class="verse" id="V3">3&#160;</span>I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.” </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>These are the two olive trees and the two lamp stands, standing before the Lord of the earth.  <span class="verse" id="V5">5&#160;</span>If anyone desires to harm them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies. If anyone desires to harm them, he must be killed in this way.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>These have the power to shut up the sky, that it may not rain during the days of their prophecy. They have power over the waters, to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them.  <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>Their dead bodies will be in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>From among the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations, people will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days, and will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>Those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them, and they will be glad.

Great fear fell on those who saw them.  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>I heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here!” They went up into heaven in a cloud, and their enemies saw them.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>In that day there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>The second woe is past.
