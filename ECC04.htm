There is no end to all of his labor, neither are his eyes satisfied with wealth. “For whom then do I labor and deprive my soul of enjoyment?” This also is vanity. Yes, it is a miserable business. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him who is alone when he falls, and doesn’t have another to lift him up.  <span class="verse" id="V11">11&#160;</span>Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one keep warm alone?  <span class="verse" id="V12">12&#160;</span>If a man prevails against one who is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>Better is a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who doesn’t know how to receive admonition any more.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>For out of prison he came out to be king; yes, even in his kingdom he was born poor.  <span class="verse" id="V15">15&#160;</span>I saw all the living who walk under the sun, that they were with the youth, the other, who succeeded him.  <span class="verse" id="V16">16&#160;</span>There was no end of all the people, even of all them over whom he was—yet those who come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a chasing after wind. </div><ul class='tnav'>
