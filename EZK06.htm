The Lord Yahweh says to the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys: “Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword on you, and I will destroy your high places.  <span class="verse" id="V4">4&#160;</span>Your altars will become desolate, and your incense altars will be broken.

I will scatter your bones around your altars.  <span class="verse" id="V6">6&#160;</span>In all your dwelling places, the cities will be laid waste and the high places will be desolate, so that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your incense altars may be cut down, and your works may be abolished.  <span class="verse" id="V7">7&#160;</span>The slain will fall among you, and you will know that I am Yahweh. </div><div class='p'> <span class="verse" id="V8">8&#160;</span>“ ‘ “Yet I will leave a remnant, in that you will have some that escape the sword among the nations, when you are scattered through the countries.  <span class="verse" id="V9">9&#160;</span>Those of you that escape will remember me among the nations where they are carried captive, how I have been broken with their lewd heart, which has departed from me, and with their eyes, which play the prostitute after their idols. Then they will loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.  <span class="verse" id="V10">10&#160;</span>They will know that I am Yahweh.

He who is near will fall by the sword. He who remains and is besieged will die by the famine. Thus I will accomplish my wrath on them.  <span class="verse" id="V13">13&#160;</span>You will know that I am Yahweh when their slain men are among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all the tops of the mountains, under every green tree, and under every thick oak—the places where they offered pleasant aroma to all their idols.  <span class="verse" id="V14">14&#160;</span>I will stretch out my hand on them and make the land desolate and waste, from the wilderness toward Diblah, throughout all their habitations.
